</header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p>In this <em>GKR: Heavy Hitters</em> review, we break down the brand new, miniatures tabletop game from <a href="https://www.cryptozoic.com/">Cryptozoic Entertainment</a> and <a href="http://wetaworkshop.com/">Weta Workshop</a>. Designed by Matt Hyra, <em>Heavy Hitters</em>
 has its players climbing into the cockpits of Giant Killer Robots as 
they battle for supremacy over a deserted city. The winner secures 
salvaging rights for their sponsor, so the stakes are high! For our 
thoughts on this epic game, read on below.</p>

<h2>D reviews GKR: Heavy Hitters</h2>

 note: this review is meant to accompany our gameplay video and will not
 go in-depth on the game’s rules. If you’re interested in learning how 
the game is played, please watch the <a href="https://boardcrazygames.com/gkr-heavy-hitters-playthrough/">video</a>. It’s not bad.)</em></p>
<p><em>Giant Killer Robots: Heavy Hitters </em>(henceforth referred to as <em>GKR</em>) is ridiculously <em>huge</em>.
 Honestly, when I first saw inside its box, I felt overwhelmed in a way 
that I rarely am by board games. I’ve played my share of big games over 
the years, but in terms of the sheer amount of <em>stuff</em> that comes with the box, perhaps only <em>Twilight Imperium</em>
 has it beat. Hell, even its name is oversized. This anxiety I felt was 
perhaps exacerbated by the fact that we are in possession of the <em>Pilot Edition</em>
 that comes with a second (huge) box filled with higher quality 
components for the game, as well as some completely new ones and some 
completely superfluous ones, like holographic pilot cards. Bigger isn’t 
always better, but it’s undeniable that an incredible, commendable 
amount of work went into the design and production of <em>GKR</em>. But I also definitely had some reservations going into this one.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3264" src="assets/Green-Combat-Support-Mini.jpg" alt="GKR: Heavy Hitters review - green combat drone" sizes="(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px" width="254" height="262">And don’t misunderstand, I <em>love</em> sinking my teeth into a weighty game, but <em>GKR </em>is
 somewhat unlike any other game that I’ve personally played before. It’s
 a wargame, sure, but my experiences with wargames up to this point are 
games like <em>Axis &amp; Allies </em>and <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, where you’re in control of small armies on a defined, zoomed-out map. <em>GKR</em>, meanwhile, seems to have a bit more in common with miniatures wargames like <em>Warhammer</em>,
 a series of which I, admittedly, have very little knowledge and 
absolutely no hands-on experience. It’s possible I’m way off-base with 
that assessment, but the scale and use of terrain were quite new to me. 
Fortunately, my fears were allayed as I read through the (mostly very 
good) rulebook and came to the realization that, while massive in scale,
 <em>GKR</em> is not impossibly complex. There are a lot of rules to 
learn, yes, but they are very coherently explained and almost all of 
them make logical sense. That said, I don’t think the rules are <em>perfect</em>, but they are reasonably easy to understand and remember, with perhaps one or two exceptions.</p>
<p>Gameplay proceeds pretty slowly for the most part, but only because there is a lot of strategy that needs to be considered, <em>not</em>
 because the game is confusing or overly difficult. It’s not the most 
satisfying strategy game I’ve ever played, as there is a somewhat 
limited amount of feinting and deception available, but overall, <em>GKR</em>
 is a fun game to play. Part of the fun comes from the game’s ability to
 tap into a more juvenile part of your brain. The Heavy Hitters don’t 
have any moving parts, but shifting them around the map and having them 
battle it out is definitely reminiscent of playing with action figures 
as a child, albeit at a much slower pace. The skyscrapers that provide 
cover help with this as well and provide a great sense of immersion. In 
terms of mechanics, the use of dice to resolve attacks, repairs, and 
damage taken will never be my favorite mechanic, but I think the game 
does a good job of creating excitement while making sure that luck 
doesn’t play <em>too</em> big of a part in the outcome. And the fact 
that each Heavy Hitter comes with unique weaponry goes a long way 
towards making combat varied and strategic.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-3262" src="assets/Blue-Recon-ScootnShoot.jpg" alt="GKR: Heavy Hitters review - blue recon card" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" width="230" height="321">I do have some mild issues with <em>GKR</em>,
 though. As I mentioned above, it’s difficult to deceive or surprise 
your opponents. The easiest way to do this is via use of the Sponsor 
Cards, which are gained through tagging buildings. Thematically, I 
understand their inclusion, but I don’t think they work well as-is. 
They’re too easy to earn, so it’s not very satisfying when you use them 
to sabotage your enemies. Instead, it just feels kind of cheap. Frankly,
 I’m not sure I would have included them at all, but at the very least I
 think they should be more difficult to acquire. And their usefulness 
varies wildly; it might have been better if there were a selection of 
face-up cards to draw from in addition to the face-down deck, to limit 
the amount of luck involved.</p>
<p>Also – and this is a more personal preference – I wish <em>GKR</em> 
allowed for a greater amount of mobility for the Heavy Hitters. There 
are only a couple of movement cards that can be included in your deck; 
most of them are focused on weaponry and deploying support units. 
Between this and the fact that each space of movement costs precious 
energy, the Heavy Hitters are all sort of forced to be lumbering tanks. 
You can keep your distance from your opponents if you want, but once you
 get closer and start initiating combat, it’s pretty much impossible to 
get out. I assume that this was a conscience design choice and the Heavy
 Hitters are <em>supposed</em> to be lacking in maneuverability, but I 
would love to have the option to pick-and-pop and really utilize the 
angles and cover more than you currently can.</p>

 is awesome to look at. Unpacking it and cleaning it up might be a bit 
of a chore, but once the board is all set up and the minis are in 
position, this is one of the cooler looking tabletop games I’ve played. I
 actually don’t completely love the designs of the Heavy Hitters and 
their support units – they’re a bit chaotic and awkward for my tastes – 
but there is no doubting that they are striking and have a certain 
“cool” factor. The cel-shaded art found on the Pilot and Sponsor cards 
is also very well done and really helps establish the dystopian, 
cyberpunk-y world that the game is set in. Also, the cardboard buildings
 that come with the base game are pretty well-made and are plastered 
with a bunch of humorous signs, but the <em>Pilot Edition</em> also 
comes with plastic ones that you can decorate yourself with included 
stickers, for added durability and customization. Overall, the game 
provides quantity and quality in equal measure.</p>
<p><em>GKR</em> is definitely not going to be for everyone. In addition 
to perhaps being prohibitively expensive, it is a longer game (about two
 hours) and is probably best served by being played often so that 
strategies and deck builds can be properly developed. Also, while rules 
for solo play exist, this is one that’s going to be best enjoyed when 
playing with a few friends. Still, if it’s within your budget and you 
find yourself compelled by what you saw in our video or read in our 
reviews, I would definitely recommend checking it out. It’s not perfect,
 but it’s a lot of fun.</p>
<p>D’s Rating: Four Stars out of Five</p>
<h2>Will reviews GKR: Heavy Hitters</h2>
<p><em><img class="alignleft wp-image-835" src="assets/Will_Headshot-e1494900306817.png" alt="GKR: Heavy Hitters review - Will" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" width="150" height="200"></em>Unlike
 my compatriot D, I was neither surprised nor intimidated when I saw the
 sheer quantity of components (and dense rulebook) included with <em>Giant Killer Robots: Heavy Hitters </em>(which I’ll also refer to as <em>“GKR”</em>).
 After all, a full-size tabletop wargame is going to be big because it 
has to be – there’s a lot going on. In fact, I would go as far as to say
 that I was pleased by the size and weight of <em>GKR</em> before I ever
 played it. I rarely anticipate games with such optimism anymore, and 
I’m really glad to report that this game kicks serious butt. With 
mind-blowingly well-made miniatures, superb artwork, and for the most 
part, outstanding gameplay design, <em>GKR </em>strikes all the right notes and in some ways, sets a new bar for what tabletop wargaming should be.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3261" src="assets/Blue-GKR-Mini.jpg" alt="GKR: Heavy Hitters review - Blue Heavy Hitter mini" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" width="352" height="503">Upon opening the special Kickstarter edition of <em>GKR: Heavy Hitters</em>,
 I quickly realized the ambition that was behind this game. The 
miniatures included, especially the giant robot ones, are insanely 
detailed and eye-catching. And this is pretty uniform across the board 
with this game – everything looks spectacular. Build quality is 
similarly impressive, with each and every mini being molded from a 
sturdy, high-quality plastic that should hold up through wear and tear. 
Some of the bonuses included with the Kickstarter edition take this game
 over the top, with the plastic tower pieces and holographic cards being
 especially notable. And then there’s the artwork, which is uniformly 
fetching, to say the least. I really adore the cel-shaded style the 
artists went for here – fans of the <em>Borderlands</em> video games will surely love it. If I were grading this game for build and aesthetics alone, I’d give it a resounding <strong>A+</strong>.</p>
<p>As we all know, tabletop games are more than just their art and components – gameplay matters most. Thankfully, <em>GKR</em>’s
 gameplay is pretty stellar, even if it suffers from a few flaws. 
Starting with the Deploy Phase, players place their supporting units on 
the board, adjacent to their Heavy Hitter. This phase is pretty 
straightforward, and I appreciate that certain cards make it more 
affordable to deploy, which normally costs four Energy – that’s a lot 
when you only have five to spend per round. After the Deploy Phase, 
there’s the Movement Phase, which is also rather straightforward. In a 
specific order, the Heavy Hitters and support drones move around the 
board into their pilots’ desired locations. Support robots move for 
free, but the Heavy Hitters require one Energy per hex. That may not 
sound like a lot, but again, you only get five Energy per round. Spend 
any more than that and you’ll tap into your negative Energy, which 
causes you to lose cards.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-3266" src="assets/Ike-Orange-Pilot.jpg" alt="GKR: Heavy Hitters review - Ike Orange Pilot" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px" width="269" height="382">Very early on, I realized that managing my Energy would be a key strategy in <em>GKR</em>.
 In truth, it’s one of the game’s cleverest but most frustrating 
mechanics. The following phase, the Combat Phase, also possibly requires
 Energy expenditures, as both primary and secondary weapons require 
Energy to fire. It’s weird – it’s almost as if the Heavy Hitter robots 
are secondary in importance to the support drones, considering how 
costly it can be to do anything with the big guys. The game is called <em>Giant Killer Robots</em>
 after all, and yet, these “Giant Killers” seem awfully weak sometimes. 
Granted, proper management of your Energy will allow you to do some 
damage with them, but still, after the Movement Phase, you’ll most 
likely have only enough energy for a secondary attack. This is a real 
shame and one of <em>GKR’s </em>noticeable issues.</p>
<p>After combat, there’s the Tagging Phase, when you’ll “tag” any 
adjacent buildings with some colorful plastic pieces. Tag a building 
four times and it’s destroyed, and once you destroy four buildings, you 
instantly win the game. I should point out – tagging doesn’t cost any 
Energy and is a valid way to try to win. However, once your opponents 
start blasting you with lasers and missile strikes, you’ll realize that 
there’s little chance you’ll be victorious through tagging. Still, it 
was nice that they added in a secondary win condition, as it brings a 
little variety to the gameplay and thus, your strategy.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3265" src="assets/Green-Primary-Indecent.jpg" alt="GKR: Heavy Hitters review - Green Primary Attack" sizes="(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px" width="251" height="352">Once
 the Tagging Phase is complete, you enter the Reset Phase, replenish 
your hand, and start a new round. Before the reset, you draw Sponsor 
Cards for each building you tagged during the round (tags also smartly 
determine the first player). These Sponsor Cards throw curveballs into 
what’s otherwise pretty straightforward wargame gameplay. For instance, 
some of these cards allow you to “hack” an opponent’s system, preventing
 them from firing their weapons. There are also counter-hack cards that 
reverse the effects onto the player who first attempted to hack you. 
While these are only two examples, you probably understand how these 
Sponsor Cards work. For me, I’m split on these cards. On one hand, they 
add a bit of randomness and screw-someone-ever appeal to what could end 
up being an otherwise bland round. On the other hand, you spend a lot of
 time moving, strategizing, and coordinating attacks in this game, so 
having all that messed up by cards that seem too easy to collect is a 
bit annoying. I get that they’re meant to annoy, but I don’t know, I 
just don’t care for them that much. Perhaps if they were harder to earn,
 the game would’ve felt stronger.</p>
<p>All in all, <em>GKR: Heavy Hitters </em>is one hell of a tabletop 
wargame. It isn’t particulary difficult to learn, even if there are a 
bunch of mechanics to memorize. I would go as far as to say that this 
would be a decent introductory game for people who aren’t used to combat
 board games or wargames. Component-wise, I think <em>GKR</em> is in my 
top five ever, maybe even my top three. The art is also really terrific.
 Yes, the gameplay suffers from a few imbalances and the overpowered 
Sponsor Cards, but on the whole, it’s well above average. More 
importantly, <em>GKR </em>is a lot of fun, and what else really matters 
at the end of the day. As I said earlier, in many ways this game sets a 
new bar, especially given its reasonable weight. I thoroughly recommend 
checking it out if you’re into this kind of thing.</p>
<p>I give <em>GKR: Heavy Hitters</em> an: <strong>A-</strong></p>
