</header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p>This week, Board 
Crazy reviews Whitehall Mystery, the newest addition to the Letters from
 Whitechapel series. Whitehall Mystery is designed by Gabriele Mari and 
Gianluca Santopietro and published by <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/index/">Fantasy Flight Games</a>.
 In this game, Jack is back but with a twist. He’s murdered again, but 
is now leaving a trail of evidence, the victim’s limbs. Can the 
detectives catch him before he dumps all four? Check out our reviews of 
Whitehall Mystery below!</p>

<h2>D reviews Whitehall Mystery</h2>
<p><em><img class=" wp-image-834 alignleft" src="assets/D_Headshot-e1494900449430.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 141px) 100vw, 141px" width="141" height="199">(Author’s
 note: this review is meant to accompany our gameplay video and will not
 go in-depth on the game’s rules. If you’re interested in learning how 
the game is played, please watch the video. It’s not bad.)</em></p>
<p>The premise for <em>Whitehall Mystery</em>, the new sequel to <em>Letters from Whitechapel</em>,
 is based on another real-life murder mystery that sprung up in London 
in the wake of Jack the Ripper. Instead of a bunch of murders happening 
over a series of nights, this time there is only one body, with various 
limbs being placed near the construction site of New Scotland Yard. The 
game still refers to the murderer-player as “Jack,” presumably for the 
sake of convenience, as it is not believed that Jack the Ripper was 
responsible for this murder, despite some similarities. And given that 
refrigerators weren’t a thing yet, the game designers reasonably decided
 that the murderer would have to dispose of the body parts quickly, 
which informs the major change to the way the game is played.</p>
<div id="attachment_2077" style="width: 382px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-2077" src="assets/Game-Board-1.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px" width="372" height="372"><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Whitehall Mystery’s game board, which is smaller than Letters from Whitechapel’s board. This helps the game play quicker.</em></p></div>
<p>Instead of Jack picking a murder site every round and then trying to 
maneuver back to his hideout, now he has drop spots he must reach within
 a single night. These, like the hideouts of <em>Whitechapel,</em> are 
predetermined by the Jack player and may be reached in any order. To 
give Jack a bit of help, the police start the game in the center of the 
board, but now there is no resetting between rounds, so if the police 
get on Jack’s trail, there’s a good chance they will stay there. This 
continuous chase, combined with a slightly smaller game board, leads to a
 much quicker playtime than you would usually get with <em>Whitechapel.</em> I still maintain that these games would make more sense with some sort of timing mechanism for the investigators, but overall <em>Whitehall Mystery</em> is a much more manageable time commitment than <em>Whitechapel</em> was.</p>
<p>The reduced player count is also responsible for the quicker game. 
Instead of five investigators on the trail, now there are only three. 
This is a shame for larger groups who were fans of the original, but 
overall I think this was a change for the better. The new investigators 
are also a bit more fleshed out, each coming with a special ability they
 can use once per game. The abilities are considered optional in the 
rulebook, but given that they are printed on the player tokens, it seems
 like using them is the intended way to play. I’m just not convinced by 
their balance. The new map, being a bit more compact, seems to favor the
 good guys. I obviously haven’t crunched the numbers, but it feels like 
there are fewer good places for Jack to get some distance from his 
pursuers, so giving them extra movement options makes things even harder
 for the Jack player. Jack is also provided a couple of optional 
abilities, but neither feels as useful.</p>

The ‘Boat’ is a new addition to the series – it allows Jack to move across any block of water.</em></p></div>
<p>My biggest disappointment is with the new “boat” feature. There are a
 couple of bodies of water on the map, including the River Thames, and 
boats are a new movement option for Jack that work similarly to the 
alley tokens. Unfortunately, I’m not sure they’re actually useful, since
 they basically telegraph Jack’s location. The waterways are only 
present on the bottom half of the map, so using a boat early in the game
 will cut the board in half for the investigators. Towards the end of 
the game, the good guys will know which quadrant you need to reach and 
will likely be crowding the area, so using a boat is basically an act of
 desperation. And to actually use them requires an extra couple of 
moves, which are all too precious for the Jack player.</p>
<p>Overall, I’m of two minds when it comes to <em>Whitehall Mystery</em>.
 On the one hand, this new game is definitely a tighter experience 
without losing any of the original game’s nail-biting tension. But on 
the other hand, I also feel like some of the new features are a little 
half-baked. It’s definitely something that I will recommend, but I think
 a few small tweaks could have made this an even stronger game.</p>
<p>D’s Rating: Three and One-Half Stars out of Five.</p>
<h2>Will Reviews Whitehall Mystery</h2>
<p><img class=" wp-image-835 alignleft" src="assets/Will_Headshot-e1494900306817.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" width="150" height="200">Fantasy
 Flight Games’ Letters from Whitechapel is up there with my favorite 
board games – I like it that much. So when I heard that the publisher 
was putting out a follow-up to Letters, and that it was a standalone 
title, I immediately became intrigued. When the day came and we finally 
played it, I wasn’t disappointed. Whitehall Mystery is a really 
entertaining game and a worthy successor to Letters from Whitechapel, 
but is it better than its predecessor?</p>
<p>In regards to its physical components, Whitehall Mystery is a step up
 in many ways. The board is smaller than its predecessor’s, but that’s 
not necessarily a bad thing; it’s just as visually appealing and well 
made. The tokens that represent Jack’s special movements are much 
improved, as they are larger and feature useful explanations of their 
mechanics. The only step down may be the build quality of the miniatures
 of Jack and the investigators. While they’re undoubtedly more detailed,
 they’re also plastic. I think I prefer the less detailed, wooden pieces
 included in Letters from Whitechapel.</p>
<div id="attachment_2078" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-2078" src="assets/Game-Components-1.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" width="452" height="343"><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>All of the components included in the Whitehall Mystery box.</em></p></div>
<p>At the end of the day, build quality is hardly the most important 
factor when considering a board game. Instead, it all comes down to one 
simple question: Is it fun? After playing Whitehall Mystery several 
times, I definitely can state that this game is very fun. One of the 
best decisions the designers (Gabriele Mari &amp; Gianluca Santopietro) 
made was to shorten the playtime by removing the downtime between 
rounds. Letters from Whitechapel plays out over several nights, and 
after each night, there’s a break as the board is reset. In Whitehall 
Mystery, there is no break; the gameplay is seamless and sessions move 
at a break-neck pace (at least compared to Letters).</p>
<p>While the pacing is definitely an improvement, it does carry along a 
number of negative side effects. One of the worst ones is that the game,
 like its predecessor, is irritating at times for whoever is playing as 
Jack the Ripper. Since Jack has more control over where he’s traveling 
to and when, planning becomes even more difficult. To explain – before, 
the player using Jack could strategize while the other players discussed
 their next move. Now, that player is forced to wait, listen, and 
recalculate after each detective’s turn. This is basically the same 
problem that Letters from Whitechapel had, except now there’s even <em>more</em>
 for Jack to consider and contemplate, so waiting to do so while the 
investigators deliberate is that much worse. That leads me into another 
issue I had with the shortened runtime, but this one is more minor. In 
Whitehall Mystery, the players assuming the roles of the investigators 
will want to discuss their deductions in length, the same way they would
 if they were playing Letters. However, the new rules and mechanics make
 it so that there’s less time to have such discussions, unless you’re 
playing with an extremely patient Jack. In other words, Whitehall 
Mystery changed a lot for Jack the Ripper but very little for the 
detectives, and this is occasionally problematic.</p>
<div id="attachment_2081" style="width: 309px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-2081" src="assets/Sg.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px" width="299" height="192"><p class="wp-caption-text">T<em>he detectives have special abilities that can be used once per game. Utilizing these abilities is optional.</em></p></div>
<p>There are a handful of new things for the investigators though, 
including a few, once-per-game, special abilities. For instance, one of 
the policemen can traverse bodies of water like how Jack can cross 
through alleyways. New abilities such as these are really great, 
especially when executed properly. Unfortunately, they weren’t 
necessarily balanced properly. In the several sessions of Whitehall 
Mystery we’ve played, the detectives’ special abilities far outweigh 
Jack’s special abilities in regards to effectiveness. In fact, too much 
in Whitehall Mystery favors the investigators. The new board seems 
easier to get around for the good guys, with some double-movements 
covering multiple blocks. Still, this is not a big deal if you tinker 
with the rules and find the right kind of a balance for your group. Yes,
 it would’ve been nice if the new special abilities were more 
even-handed, but Whitehall Mystery is perfectly playable without them. 
Actually, it’s better without them.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, if you strip away all of the new abilities of 
Jack and the detectives, you’ll be left with a quicker, smaller version 
of Letters from Whitechapel. I like Letters so much that I probably 
would’ve purchased Whitehall Mystery if it had been merely a shortened 
version of its predecessor. Luckily it’s not, since there’s a new twist 
when it comes to the gameplay for Jack, and new abilities for the 
police. In my eyes, all of that stuff is a nice bonus for me, so I’m 
grateful. I just wish some of the new features had been balanced a bit 
better, but even with those flaws, I still wholeheartedly recommend 
Whitehall Mystery to anyone who owns Letters from Whitechapel. Heck, I 
recommend it to anyone who’s interested in deduction board gaming. Is 
Whitehall Mystery better than its predecessor? No, it’s not. But while I
 chose to focus a bit more on the negatives here, please don’t let that 
mislead you. This game features most of the same positives that Letters 
from Whitechapel does, so our <a href="https://boardcrazygames.com/board-crazy-reviews-letters-whitechapel/">reviews</a>
 of that game should shed some light on the better aspects of this 
series. Speaking of this series, I hope they do another! Overall, 
Whitehall Mystery is a worthy entry.</p>
<p>I give Whitehall Mystery a: <strong>B</strong></p>
<h2>Graham reviews Whitehall Mystery</h2>
<p><img class=" wp-image-704 alignleft" src="assets/Headshot-Graham.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 149px) 100vw, 149px" width="149" height="200">This
 week, we head back to 19th century London once again to try and hunt 
down the deranged murderer, Jack the Ripper. Whitehall Mystery is 
Fantasy Flights’ newest addition to their Letters from Whitechapel 
series. Letters from Whitechapel is a personal favorite of mine, and you
 can check out my review <a href="https://boardcrazygames.com/board-crazy-reviews-letters-whitechapel/">here</a>.
 In Whitehall Mystery, Fantasy Flight Games did a fantastic job of 
preserving the overall feeling and satisfaction you get from playing 
Letters from Whitechapel, while still cultivating a distinctly different
 experience. Whitehall Mystery plays more quickly, adds some new 
elements, and levels the playing field a little.</p>
<p>The main difference between the two games is Jack’s goal. In Letters 
from Whitechapel, Jack is trying to commit five separate murders over 
the course of four different nights. Each night, Jack murders and then 
tries to get back to his hideout before the detectives catch him. In 
Whitehall Mystery, jack has committed one murder and is trying to leave a
 trail of evidence throughout the district. The evidence is rather 
gruesome – it’s the victim’s limbs. If Jack can successfully place these
 limbs in his predetermined locations before the detectives catch him, 
he wins.</p>
<div id="attachment_2080" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2080 size-full" src="assets/Movement-Sheet.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" width="574" height="234"><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Jack’s
 movement track sheet. At the top of this sheet, the person playing as 
Jack would mark down the four locations at which they want to drop the 
body parts.<br></em></p></div>
<p>In Letters from Whitechapel, there are four distinct rounds, and 
after each round the board changes significantly, and any information 
you collected from the last round is essentially useless. In Whitehall 
Mystery, the transition between rounds is very seamless. All of the 
players stay in position, and only the clue markers from the previous 
round get removed. This means the entire game plays as one round from 
start to finish, while in Letters from Whitechapel, each round almost 
felt like you were starting a brand new game. This, in addition to a 
smaller game board, significantly decreases the gameplay time. I think 
we finished our game of Letters from Whitechapel in a little over two 
hours, while Whitehall Mystery was maybe 45 minutes total. The length of
 Letters from Whitechapel didn’t bother me, but I would be lying if I 
said I didn’t appreciate a quicker version of it.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Whitehall Mystery is a smaller game overall, 
but that doesn’t mean they took anything important away from Letters 
from Whitechapel. In fact, they added some new elements to the game that
 definitely make it more intriguing. First, they gave special abilities 
to the detectives. The detectives can use these special abilities once 
per game, and these abilities are explained on the individual detective 
cards. There’s also a dog, Smoker, that works alongside the journalist 
Jasper T.C. Waring. He gives Jasper an additional special ability to use
 once per game. These special abilities are optional, but I think they 
provide a nice twist to the original gameplay. I do recommend that if 
you’re playing with the detectives special abilities, you also allow 
Jack to play with some of his optional mechanics. In addition to the 
special abilities, they added the ‘boat’ special movement. This special 
movement allows Jack to move between any two blue circles on the same 
block of water. If you decide to allow the detectives’ special 
abilities, then Sgt. Arthur Ferris can use this type of movement as 
well.</p>

Waring and his dog, Smoker.</em></p></div>
<p>Another thing I noticed is that the game seems to have been balanced a little bit better than Letters from Whitechapel. In <a href="https://boardcrazygames.com/board-crazy-plays-letters-whitechapel/">our playthrough</a>
 of that game, Will and I barely won, and we had a significant advantage
 because we were playing one of the rules wrong. There’s no way we would
 have been victorious if we had been playing correctly. I always feel at
 a slight disadvantage when playing as a detective in Letters from 
Whitechapel. In Whitehall Mystery, we definitely made sure we were 
playing properly, and it felt more balanced overall. I think in our 
playthrough of Whitehall Mystery, Jack was only one or two spots away 
from successfully placing the last limb and winning the game.</p>
<p>Overall, Whitehall Mystery is a great take on its predecessor, 
Letters from Whitechapel. The designers found a way to introduce a new 
game that plays very differently but keeps many of the elements that I 
and countless others loved from Letters from Whitechapel. I will 
continue to play both games depending on my mood, and look forward to 
any games that are a part of this series. I give Whitehall Mystery two 
thumbs up.</p>
