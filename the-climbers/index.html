</header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p>In this <em>The Climbers</em>
 review, Board Crazy looks at the 3D abstract game that was designed by 
Holger Lanz and published by Simply Complex (from Capstone Games). In <em>The Climbers</em>,
 players endeavor to reach the highest point on the structure that they 
can before upward movement becomes impossible. Read on for our thoughts 
on this game!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2705 " src="assets/The-Climbers-Cover-Art.png" alt="The Climbers Review" sizes="(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px" width="255" height="460"></p>
<h2>D reviews The Climbers</h2>
<p><em><img class=" wp-image-834 alignleft" src="assets/D_Headshot-e1494900449430.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 141px) 100vw, 141px" width="141" height="199">(Author’s
 note: this review is meant to accompany our gameplay video and will not
 go in-depth on the game’s rules. If you’re interested in learning how 
the game is played, please watch the <a href="https://boardcrazygames.com/the-climbers-playthrough-board-crazy/">video</a>. It’s not bad.)</em></p>
<p>Upon opening the box, <em>The Climbers</em> makes a pretty striking 
first impression. All of these colorful, wooden blocks are neatly packed
 inside, and the cute little ladders and pawns round out what is clearly
 a rather unique package. At first blush, one might assume that this is 
some sort of cousin to <em>Jenga</em>, but outside of the blocks and some precarious balancing acts, they aren’t really similar. <em>The Climbers</em>
 is all about building up instead of tearing down. So, if nothing else, I
 don’t know that I’ve really played a game quite like it before. <em>Santorini</em> is also an abstract 3D strategy game, but their gameplay has next to nothing in common.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-2698 " src="assets/Game-Setup-1.png" alt="The Climbers Review - Different Colored Blocks" sizes="(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px" width="373" height="330">So, <em>The Climbers</em>
 is pretty unique, which is not nothing, but is it good? That’s a 
trickier question. Actually understanding the rules is frustratingly 
difficult. The rulebook is quite vague on a number of points, so a first
 playthrough can be a confused affair. Though, once everyone has a 
firmer grasp on what they can and should be doing, <em>The Climbers</em>
 offers a pretty fun experience. There is something innately appealing 
about playing and building with blocks. Just look at the success of Lego
 and <em>Minecraft</em> if you’re unsure that that’s true. It appeals to
 people of all ages and backgrounds. So yeah, building and rearranging 
the structure of <em>The Climbers</em> is an enjoyable experience. And 
trying to wrap your head around the best moves to set yourself up for 
continued success provides a real challenge. The game is published in a 
product line called Simply Complex, and I would say that is an apt 
descriptor of this game’s experience. It’s not a complicated game, but 
it’s not easy either.</p>
<p>The game does have some obvious drawbacks, though. The random 
assembly of the structure and random drawing of your color can lead to 
situations where some players have a clear advantage over others in 
terms of maneuverability. And there can definitely be an advantage to 
getting very high, very quickly. Fortunately, sessions of <em>The Climbers</em>
 don’t take very long, but it only requires one player not having fun to
 bring down a group. Also, while the blocks do allow for a good amount 
of stability, there is always the danger of the structure getting 
accidentally knocked over, so choosing an appropriate surface and 
location is important. It’s not really an easy game to play sitting 
down, either, as you’ll want to see every angle of the tower. In the 
video, we built it on a platter in order to allow us to rotate it 360 
degrees. I recommend this, as it prevents players from having to 
constantly get up and look around it, which can run the risk of people 
accidentally bumping it or the table.</p>

 while I did mention that the game makes a good first impression, I do 
have a couple issues with the components. The paint on the blocks 
started to chip off slightly after just one session, and it’s not like 
we were playing rough with them. They look good when they’re pristine, 
but I imagine they won’t look that good after several playthroughs. 
Also, and I’m not sure who is to blame for this, but the rulebook was 
not packaged in the game box that we received, so we had to look them up
 online. I don’t know if this is a common issue, but I would hope it 
isn’t because while it may not be a big problem for us, others with less
 immediate access to the internet wouldn’t be able to play the game 
without it. I won’t give this game a lower score because of that, but it
 definitely didn’t leave a good impression on me. Overall, <em>The Climbers</em> is unique and pretty fun, but not a game I’d be too eager to return to all that often.</p>

<h2>Will reviews The Climbers</h2>
<p><img class=" wp-image-835 alignleft" src="assets/Will_Headshot-e1494900306817.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" width="150" height="200">Every
 once in a while, I run into a tabletop game that I appreciate more in 
theory than in reality. By that, I mean I like the idea of the game more
 than the game itself, since the game itself was too difficult to 
execute in a satisfying manner. Now, given that The Climbers is part of 
the Simply Complex line from Capstone Games, I didn’t expect it to be 
one of those games. After all, something that’s “simply complex” 
shouldn’t be too difficult to design, and I’ve said in many reviews 
before, my favorite games are the ones that combine simplicity and 
nuance. Yet with The Climbers, I walked away with a sour taste in my 
mouth that I wasn’t originally expecting. It’s the same sour taste I get
 whenever I play a game that works better on paper than it does on the 
table.</p>
<p>Initially, there’s a lot to like about The Climbers. When I picked up
 the box for the first time, I was really surprised by the weight of it –
 it was very heavy. That’s because all of the physical components 
(blocks, meeples, ladders) are made of wood, which is always a nice 
touch. The game is also very colorful, which is also always a plus. I 
should point out – our copy of The Climbers came without a rulebook. I 
can only assume that this was a packaging error, and it doesn’t affect 
my opinion of the game. Still, not packaging a rulebook reflects poorly 
on the publisher.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-2700 alignleft" src="assets/Large-Ladder-with-Block.png" alt="The Climbers Review - Tall Ladder with Red Block" sizes="(max-width: 157px) 100vw, 157px" width="157" height="329">Before
 starting a game, there’s also a lot to like about the gameplay. The 
idea that you’re trying to scale a tower of vibrantly colored blocks is 
intriguing, and I definitely couldn’t wait to get started. I also 
admired the mechanic that allowed each player to rotate/move a block 
once per turn, as that would have the structure in a state of constant 
flux. Again, I was very excited for The Climbers, in theory. But then we
 started playing this game, and slowly I began noticing a number of 
flaws. Let’s start with one that shouldn’t bother me as much as it does,
 given that it’s inherent in these kinds of games, but still does 
anyways. I’m referring to the three-dimensional (3D) nature of games 
like The Climbers. While it’s cool in concept, actually getting up and 
walking around the tower is a hassle. Events might unfold on the 
opposite side of the blocks from where you’re sitting, and in a game 
where you really can’t afford to miss your opponents’ moves, this is 
undoubtedly problematic. If you’re without something that allows you to 
rotate the mountain, I recommend playing this game standing. But if 
you’re like me, then you hate standing. Objectively, criticizing a 3D 
game for being 3D is kind of stupid, but I stand by my opinion.</p>
<p>Another flaw I couldn’t help but to notice is that there aren’t many 
disparate strategies to follow in The Climbers. You can either take your
 time and work your way up, or you can utilize your ladders early and 
get into a quick lead. In our experience, the latter is far more 
effective, as the highest player can start harassing the lower players 
by removing their options for upward movement. Honestly, I wouldn’t 
recommend any other strategy because if you take your time, especially 
against experienced players, you’re going to lose. And when one strategy
 becomes so obviously effective, it badly hurts replayability. I’m not 
saying that the quick-climb strategy will work 100% of the time, but it 
works enough that it should come into play during most sessions.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-2701 alignright" src="assets/Medium-Block-Capacity.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" width="288" height="297">Lastly,
 if you don’t enjoy the element of luck in your games, then you probably
 won’t love The Climbers. The block mountain is set up prior to the 
meeples being chosen, which means that the color you end up with might 
be in a bad way from the get-go. It could also go the other way. Let’s 
say that you’re using the yellow meeple, and you look at the mountain 
and notice that several yellow blocks are in fortuitous positions. In 
that situation, you would be able to scale quicker than someone who has 
to spend each turn rotating and moving blocks. If you were to play this 
game enough, I imagine that layout and luck would eventually swing your 
way. It’s for that reason that the luck factor doesn’t bother me too 
much here, but it was definitely important to point out.</p>
<p>All in all, The Climbers is too frustrating gameplay-wise for me to 
recommend it to everyone. I did appreciate the game’s build-quality and 
3D puzzle mechanics, but I was bothered by almost everything else. 
Personally, I didn’t find the gameplay to be fun enough to justify the 
amount of work (and standing) to play The Climbers. All of the 
excitement that I felt early on was quickly replaced with disappointment
 and annoyance. This game works a lot better in theory than it does on a
 gaming table, and that’s a real shame. I have no doubt that there’s an 
audience for The Climbers; I’m just not part of it.</p>
<p>I give The Climbers a: <strong>C</strong></p>
<h2>Graham reviews The Climbers</h2>
<p><img class=" wp-image-704 alignleft" src="assets/Headshot-Graham.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 149px) 100vw, 149px" width="149" height="200">We recently played a game called <a href="https://boardcrazygames.com/onitama-playthrough-board-crazy/">Onitama</a>
 – it’s a pretty neat abstract strategy game. In my review of Onitama, I
 mentioned how we need to play more abstract games because they tend to 
have a simple brilliance to them. Most of the time, these games have 
intuitive rules, few mechanics, and minimal luck involved. It creates a 
balanced gameplay experience, in which the strategy naturally forms, and
 it usually comes down to a battle of wits. The Climbers has a lot of 
the same aspects that I’ve seen in most other abstract strategy games, 
but it just never really clicked. I didn’t get that same satisfaction 
out of it that I do other similar board games like Onitama, Santorini, 
or Element.</p>
<p>I think the main thing that bothers me about The Climbers is that 
it’s chaotic and random, but not in a balanced way. The setup involves 
all players constructing the tower, and it’s pretty simple. You place 
two neutral colored blocks standing vertically in the center, then you 
randomly place the colored blocks all around the center blocks so that 
they are completely covered. This process makes the structure completely
 random, and if you happen to get stuck with a color that isn’t well 
represented, you’re kind of screwed. I feel like in most abstract games,
 the environment is completely neutral so that the game is fair, or that
 the randomization happens on a much smaller scale, so that you have 
more control over it. I will admit – it is fun to build the structure, 
but I just don’t think it’s the best way if you want to have a balanced 
and competitive game.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-2696" src="assets/All-Block-Sizes.png" alt="The Climbers Review - Different Block Heights" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" width="351" height="251">The
 next thing that frustrates me about The Climbers is that there really 
isn’t that much strategy in it. Each turn feels very disjointed, and the
 game ultimately comes down to who can get to the highest point the 
quickest. If you can do that, then you can play defensively and it 
becomes very simple. It’s also weird because I feel like there is a lot 
you can do on your turn, but it doesn’t feel like it really amounts to 
anything. Each turn, a player can move up as many blocks as possible, as
 well as take a block from almost anywhere on the board, rotate it, and 
then move it to basically wherever they want. In reality, your turn will
 typically have you moving a block so that you can climb up one space. 
Repeat that for 10 turns, and that’s usually how the game plays out. You
 can see how it might get boring pretty quickly.</p>
<p>And then there’s the rulebook… I’m not really going to get into this 
too much. I found the rulebook to be unhelpful and confusing, which made
 learning the game a process. After about ten minutes with the rulebook,
 we gave up and watched the ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjL6_zOXXIs">Watch It Played</a>‘ for The Climbers. Thank you, Rodney.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-2702 alignright" src="assets/Small-Block-Capacity.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" width="244" height="117">I
 will mention that even though there’s a lot about The Climbers that I 
don’t like, I really do appreciate the pieces. All of the components are
 made out of solid wood, and they are painted pretty nicely. Everything 
is well constructed, and it almost feels like each piece gets crafted 
individually rather than being made on some assembly line.</p>
<p>This game seemed promising when I first saw it, especially with my 
new-found fondness for abstract strategy games. Unfortunately, it really
 didn’t live up to expectations. I guess The Climbers had some pretty 
stiff competition, because Onitama and Santorini are two games I really 
love. The Climbers feels like a game that would do well with younger 
kids, and it doesn’t seem to be a competitive game that enthusiasts can 
get really into. Overall, I give The Climbers one thumb down.</p>
