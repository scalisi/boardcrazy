</header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p>In this <em>The Castles of Burgundy </em>review, D and Will analyze the 2011 Euro-style, dice-rolling board game from <a href="https://www.ravensburger.us/products/games/ff_ravensburger_marken_vv_alea/category.html">Ravensburger</a>
 and alea. Designed by Stefan Feld, this game has its players rolling 
dice, choosing from a number of actions, and building up their estate in
 a predetermined pattern. The player who does this most effectively will
 earn the most victory points and subsequently win the game. Over the 
years, this game has become a classic, but is it worthy of its praise? 
We try to determine that and more in our reviews below.</p>

 note: this review is meant to accompany our gameplay video and will not
 go in-depth on the game’s rules. If you’re interested in learning how 
the game is played, please watch the <a href="https://boardcrazygames.com/the-castles-of-burgundy-playthrough/">video</a>. It’s not bad.)</em></p>
<p>I realize that this opinion is unlikely to win me many fans, but <em>The Castles of Burgundy</em>
 has left me feeling really cold. I get why it’s highly regarded by so 
many people – mechanically, this game is absolutely rock solid and 
highly replayable. But now, after having played it a few times… I kind 
of don’t want to play it again. It doesn’t excite me or make me want to 
get a better understanding of its strategy. I’ve played it, and I don’t 
regret that I’ve played it, but I’ve also played a lot of games like 
this and I’m not sure <em>The Castles of Burgundy</em> has any one 
element that really separates it from the (ever-growing) pack in my 
mind. It probably doesn’t help its cause that we played <em>Heaven &amp; Ale </em>recently,
 a newer game that I really enjoyed, with which it shares some obvious 
similarities. Specifically, tile-based tableau building, player 
interaction limited mainly to tile denial, a good number of options in 
terms of strategy, and a medieval European setting. And I just can’t 
help but feel like <em>Burgundy</em>’s blending of these aspects was done somewhat less successfully.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-4862" src="assets/Location_Tiles.jpg" alt="The Castles of Burgundy review - location tiles" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" width="300" height="322">I think <em>The Castles of Burgundy</em>
 suffers from a lack of scarcity and tension. I know that Euros are 
generally more “peaceful” experiences, but it rarely feels like there 
are any stakes to worry about whatsoever. Sure, your dice rolls might 
not always be optimal, but the game provides good flexibility with the 
worker tokens. And, even if you can’t fudge your rolls as much as you’d 
like, there’s basically always something productive you can do on your 
turn, be it taking a tile, collecting workers, or selling some goods. I 
admit that this probably sounds like an unusual criticism – always 
having something to do on your turn is generally a good thing – but in 
this case I think the game goes a bit too far in being forgiving. In 
fact, I would hesitate to even call it <em>competitive</em>. At the end 
of our video (Spoilers), I had lost, but my reaction was basically a 
mental shrug of the shoulders. Part of that was due to the fact that it 
was obvious about halfway through the game that Will was going to win. 
However, another source of this apathy was that I thought we had all 
done perfectly fine jobs of establishing highly functional estates and 
the actual differences between any of them wasn’t particularly obvious. 
And much of the blame for this lack of distinction can be directed at 
the game’s scoring system and use of theme.</p>
<p>If I had to describe <em>The Castles of Burgundy</em>’s use of theme 
in one word, it would be “perfunctory.” Or maybe “superficial.” Or, 
possibly, just “extant.” It has one, but absolutely nothing outside of 
the game’s title would lead me to believe that it’s set specifically in 
France. (As an aside, if you’re not going to incorporate France’s rich 
history and culture into the game, why not choose a more unique setting 
to give the game an extra bit of flair? How about somewhere in Africa? 
Or South America? Or on the moon?) But whatever, you’re in France and in
 control of some land, and you need to do something with that land. And 
that’s it. You never get the sense that you’re gaining any power, either
 individually or in relation to your opponents. Are those buildings and 
(thematically questionable) knowledge tiles you have necessarily 
superior to your opponents’ ships and farm animals? Is success mostly 
just dependent on not doing the same thing as your opponents? It’s not 
very clear, and I think the game could maybe use an extra system, 
perhaps a market or government, where players can actually throw the 
weight of their princedoms around in order to make their strengths and 
weaknesses more tangible. <em>Kingdomino</em> is a game that has a similar theme and it clearly rewards cohesion and collecting crowns. <em>Heaven &amp; Ale</em>’s
 theme is also similar, and it informs that game’s intricate and clever 
scoring system. When it’s over, it makes perfect sense why the winner’s 
beer was the best of the bunch. With <em>Burgundy</em>, everything feels a little too subjective to be truly satisfying or disappointing.</p>

 also leaves something to be desired. The art is functional, but bland. 
It certainly doesn’t inspire much excitement as you’re taking it out of 
the box. And again, nothing about it even whispers “France.” It’s 
Burgundy! Throw in a vineyard somewhere! A quick google search makes it 
clear that the art doesn’t do its setting justice. At least the box is 
burgundy is color. The components are functional, but there’s a bit of 
cheapness to the cardboard pieces. I can forgive this though, given that
 it’s probably a necessary evil in order to keep the game’s price down. 
The rulebook is good, and it needs to be. You’ll be referencing it often
 until you’re more familiar with the game’s shorthand symbology. Overall
 though, this is not a game that you get for how it looks, it’s a game 
you get for how it plays.</p>

 again, I really can’t fault the mechanics at their very core. The way 
that tiles are taken, played, and delivered in relation to the dice is 
pretty clever and doesn’t get boring. And while the goal of the game is a
 somewhat uninspiring “get points”, it’s easy to admire the flexibility 
the game allows in coming up with strategies to work towards that goal. 
The game can drag, especially with new players or higher play counts. 
I’d probably recommend this mainly for just two players or maybe three 
very experienced ones. Otherwise you’re looking <em>at least </em>at a two-hour session, and I just don’t think the game is engaging enough to warrant such a lengthy commitment. <em>The Castles of Burgundy</em>
 is not a bad game, but its many elements don’t add up to offer the kind
 of entertainment I usually find myself looking for when I play a board 
game. A lot of people love it though, so check it out if you think it 
might be for you.</p>

<h2>Will reviews The Castles of Burgundy</h2>
<p><em><strong><img class="alignleft wp-image-835" src="assets/Will_Headshot-e1494900306817.png" alt="The Castles of Burgundy review - Will" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" width="150" height="200"></strong></em>We
 don’t often play well known, highly regarded, Euro-style board games at
 Board Crazy. It’s not that we don’t like them; it’s that we often don’t
 have enough time for them and that we like to feature quicker, more 
competitive games on the channel. However, every once and a while we 
branch out and give one a go, which is what we did this week with <em>The Castles of Burgundy</em>.
 This is a game that has a reputation for being fair, intelligent, and 
suited for smaller groups. After playing it a few times, I’d say this 
reputation is earned, although many games have surpassed it over the 
years, making it seem… a bit bland.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-4861" src="assets/Goods_Tiles.jpg" alt="The Castles of Burgundy review - goods tiles" sizes="(max-width: 263px) 100vw, 263px" width="263" height="262">Speaking of blandness, my goodness <em>The Castles of Burgundy’</em>s
 components are boring and uninspired. I understand Euros stand tall 
upon their mechanics instead of their art and themes, but come on – this
 is unacceptable. There’s so much brown, green, and greenish brown. 
Heck, even the yellow has a greenish, unappealing hue to it. And nothing
 about it really screams Burgundy or even France to me. This game 
could’ve just as easily been called <em>The Castles of Cornwall</em> and
 I would’ve believed it. Sure, I’m an American and therefore perhaps a 
bit unsophisticated and unworldly, but I’m fairly certain most people 
aren’t transported to east-central France when playing this.</p>
<p>What makes the stale visuals even more bothersome is the fact that 
the gameplay really needs some enlivening that colorful, arousing 
artwork could’ve provided. Don’t get me wrong, I actually like <em>TCoB</em>’s gameplay, but at the same time, it’s about as unpredictable as an episode of <em>Antiques Roadshow</em>. I acknowledge that Euros are often fairly predictable, but only to an extent. Take <em>Heaven &amp; Ale</em>
 for example – it’s a similar game but it manages to have genuine 
moments of spontaneity and randomness. In that game, you never know if 
you’re going to have access to the ingredients you need in any one 
moment. In <em>TCoB</em>, you’ll almost always have a way to collect what you need tiles-wise because there are so many of them.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4864" src="assets/Player_Board_1.jpg" alt="The Castles of Burgundy review - basic player board" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" width="452" height="313">Perhaps
 I’m getting ahead of myself a bit, because there’s actually quite a bit
 I like about this game’s gameplay. It may be predictable and safe, but 
that much certainty creates a calm, cool-headed environment, which is 
what I prefer when taking to the tabletop. <em>TCoB</em>’s gameplay is 
actually built around a dice-rolling mechanic, which seems rather 
un-Euro-y but absolutely works here. Every D6 roll leaves you with 
something to do. Oh you rolled a five? Then collect a tile from the 
corresponding depot. There’s nothing there you want? Then place a tile 
on your player board at a five spot. Don’t want to do that? Okay, trade 
your five for a couple of worker tiles. Because this game provides you 
with an abundance of meaningful actions, it found a way to negate the 
randomness of dice-rolling.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-4867" src="assets/Worker_Tiles.jpg" alt="The Castles of Burgundy review - worker tiles" sizes="(max-width: 182px) 100vw, 182px" width="182" height="180">Then again, isn’t randomness part of the fun of dice-rolling? I really believe that <em>TCoB </em>would’ve
 been better if it was slightly harder, and offering fewer ways to 
manipulate your dice would’ve helped in that regard. With that in mind, 
the worker tiles seem especially frivolous when you consider that 
there’s already several Knowledge tiles that also allow you to change 
die values by +1/-1. Or maybe instead, limit the amount of worker tiles 
that a player can have at any time, or even better, limit how many they 
can use at a time. If you craft your strategy around the collection and 
utilization of worker tiles, <em>TCoB </em>becomes really easy, and more disappointingly, almost effortless.</p>
<p>On the bright side, since this game rarely challenges you that much, 
you’ll always know what to do on your turn. There aren’t too many 
moments where someone has to stop and really consider his or her 
strategy for longer than 30 seconds. Because of that, <em>TCoB</em> 
moves at a relatively brisk, consistent pace, which is definitely 
something I appreciate. However, after five phases consisting of 5 
rounds <em>each</em>, the overall playtime will inevitably be well over 
an hour, at least with three or more players. Sure, this game isn’t that
 challenging, but you still have to think and strategize. And when you 
sit around thinking about your turns and staring at bland browns and 
greens for 90 minutes, this game really starts to drag. Maybe it’s 
better that you play five phases so everyone gets a chance to mostly 
fill up their player boards, but in reality, it’d probably be best to 
play three phases and call it a day.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4865" src="assets/Player_Board_2.jpg" alt="The Castles of Burgundy review - complex player board" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px" width="483" height="336">Nonetheless, <em>TCoB</em>’s
 rulebook and scoring system are superb. Starting with the rulebook, 
it’s written in such a way that a relatively complex board game becomes 
easy to pick up and play in under a half hour. Pretty much everything is
 where it needs to be in the rules, so top marks there. Also, the game’s
 scoring is quite brilliant. You earn points for completing regions, 
covering entire colored sections of your board, selling goods, and then 
there are even some additional ways to score and catch up during the 
endgame. If I had to nitpick about the scoring, it’s that since you keep
 track of your total in the moment, it can become apparent when someone 
is running away with the lead. And in a game where everything is so 
consistent and structured, it can become quite obvious when you’re going
 to lose. That’s disheartening if it happens too early and can spoil the
 mood of any session.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-4872" src="assets/Screen-Shot-2018-11-30-at-4.png" alt="The Castles of Burgundy review - cows" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" width="199" height="200">As I said in my intro, many games have surpassed <em>The Castles of Burgundy</em>
 since its release in 2011. That being said, it’s important to remember 
that many of those games were likely inspired in one way or another by 
this one. What this game did well has been copied, and what it did 
poorly has been altered. <em>TCoB</em>’s design could easily be seen as 
exemplary, since it’s so balanced, fair, and cordial. But that’s just it
 – it’s too much of those things, so much so that it sabotaged itself. 
It’s not that challenging and for that reason, it doesn’t cultivate much
 competition. That fact may resonate with you – I know it does with me, 
somewhat. At the same time, I was left wanting more, even when I was 
victorious. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that <em>TCoB</em> is a really 
good Euro-style board game. It’s just that sometimes, on the tabletop, 
it is possible to have too much of a good thing.</p>
<p>I give <em>The Castles of Burgundy</em> a: <strong>B</strong></p>
