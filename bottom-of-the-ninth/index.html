</header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p>In this <em>Bottom of the 9th</em>
 review, the Board Crazy crew breaks down the baseball-themed board game
 that’s designed by Darrell Louder and Mike Mullins, and published by <a href="http://www.dicehatemegames.com/">Dice Hate Me Games</a>.
 In this game, two players assume the roles of opposing teams in the 
bottom of the ninth inning, and only one run will win it for the home 
team. For our thoughts on <em>Bottom of the 9th</em>, continue reading below.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2925" src="assets/Bottom-of-the-9th-Box.jpg" alt="bottom of the 9th review - box" sizes="(max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px" width="326" height="639"></p>
<h2>D reviews Bottom of the 9th</h2>
<p><em><img class="alignleft wp-image-834" src="assets/D_Headshot-e1494900449430.png" alt="bottom of the 9th review - d" sizes="(max-width: 141px) 100vw, 141px" width="141" height="200"></em></p>
<p><em>(Author’s note: this review is meant to accompany our gameplay 
video and will not go in-depth on the game’s rules. If you’re interested
 in learning how the game is played, please watch the <a href="https://boardcrazygames.com/bottom-9th-playthrough/">video</a>. It’s not bad.)</em></p>
<p>Ooh boy this one is frustrating. First things first: I’m a <em>huge</em>
 baseball fan. Furthermore, ever since I was a little D, I’ve had this 
fondness for made-up sports teams and leagues. Some people need the big 
league licenses to enjoy sports games, but I’ve never had that problem. 
So upon opening the box for <em>Bottom of the 9<sup>th</sup>, </em>I was
 immediately charmed by several details. The little baseball field board
 and wooden components were a good start, but the cards stole my heart. 
They come wrapped like a pack of baseball cards, and opening them filled
 me with that sense of anticipation I used to get whenever I bought a 
new pack of cards, despite all copies of this game containing (as far as
 I know) the same players. The cards themselves are cardboard and look 
and feel like old Topps cards from the 70s and 80s, which is a perfect 
choice. The players and teams that have been created for the game are 
fun and filled with personality. My only complaint with the cards is 
that I wish there were more of them (at least enough to create two full 
teams), but the expansions should take care of that little issue.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-2947" src="assets/Wake-Louder-Front.jpg" alt="bottom of the 9th review - wake louder" sizes="(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px" width="196" height="275">So
 yeah, first impressions were good, and I didn’t even mention the 
faux-bubblegum stick that is used for keeping track of balls and 
strikes. Just perusing the rulebook also made me appreciate the amount 
of thought that went into the game, which comes with separate rules for 
solo play and all sorts of suggestions for various different ways to 
play the game. The rules take some time to wrap your head around, but 
once you get them, you get them… kind of like real baseball. So far so 
good, but like I said at the outset, this one is frustrating. I really 
wish I could say I wholeheartedly love this game, but it has some 
issues.</p>
<p>Before I lay out those issues, I should mention that I think <em>Bottom of the 9<sup>th</sup></em>
 is a fun game, helped by its snappy pace and shorter playtime. I don’t 
hate it; I just wish it were better. I assume the designers were really 
trying to capture the dynamics of the duel between a pitcher and a 
batter, and I think the “stare-down” phase of each pitch – where the 
pitcher chooses where he wants to throw it and the batter tries to guess
 what’s coming – is their most successful game design decision. It’s a 
bit simplified compared to real baseball, but it comes down to deduction
 more than luck, which is disappointingly uncommon in this game. 
Correctly guessing the pitch or fooling the batter is very satisfying, 
so it’s a shame that it doesn’t pay off more.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-2951" src="assets/White-Pitchers-Dice.jpg" alt="bottom of the 9th review - dice" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" width="330" height="232">The
 actual result of the pitch isn’t often affected by the stare-down. 
Fooling the batter or guessing the pitch merely activates certain 
special abilities of the players, and whether the pitch is going to be a
 ball, a strike, or put into play almost entirely comes down to dice 
rolls. Baseball is a game of skill, albeit an extremely difficult one, 
but in this game it feels like everything comes down to luck. Guessing 
the pitch location exactly doesn’t make it any more likely for you to 
hit it, and if the pitch is out of the strike zone, it’s actually 
impossible (nobody tell Vladimir Guerrero). Even more frustrating are 
certain situations where the pitcher throws a ball that the batter can’t
 lay off or a strike that they can’t touch. I’m not saying these things 
don’t happen in real baseball, but there are also ways to mitigate this 
issue. There’s no taking a pitch, check swings, choking up, or any 
number of rules options that could be implemented to mitigate how big of
 a part luck plays in this game.</p>
<p>The base-running mechanic is kind of a good analogue for the entire 
game. The pitcher and batter both roll their dice over and over until 
one of them rolls a five or better. This mechanic has the potential to 
be tense and fun, and sometimes it can be, but oftentimes it’s kind of 
underwhelming and has little to do with real baseball. So yeah, <em>Bottom of the 9<sup>th</sup> </em>is
 a frustrating game. And you know what? I want to keep playing it. The 
baseball fan in me definitely finds some of the gameplay choices pretty 
irritating, but the board game fan in me still appreciates the high 
production value and quick, lighthearted gameplay. Or maybe it’s just 
the Mets fan in me who enjoys frustration and disappointment. I don’t 
know.</p>

<h2>Will reviews Bottom of the 9th</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-835" src="assets/Will_Headshot-e1494900306817.png" alt="bottom of the 9th review - will" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" width="150" height="200"></p>
<p>For most fans of America’s Pastime, the bottom half of the ninth 
inning is the best part of a ball game. The home team is hitting, the 
away team is pitching, and the entire game is on the line. Capturing the
 intensity and unpredictability of such a moment in the form of a board 
game seems like a difficult, if not impossible, task. However, this 
game’s designers, Darrell Louder and Mike Mullins, figured out a way to 
do it. <em>Bottom of the 9<sup>th</sup></em> is a wild game of deduction, luck, and occasionally, pure adrenaline.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-2953" src="assets/Kerry-Rumble-Front.jpg" alt="bottom of the 9th review - kerry rumble" sizes="(max-width: 213px) 100vw, 213px" width="213" height="296">Among the first things that struck me in regards to <em>Bottom of the 9<sup>th</sup></em> was its artwork by Adam P. McIver, the designer of <em>Ex Libris</em>. Similar to that game, the art in <em>Bottom of 9<sup>th</sup></em>
 is eye-catching and humorous. All of the players that you can use, both
 pitchers and hitters, are drawn in a way that evokes happy memories of 
going to a ball game as a child. Nearly every baseball stereotype is 
covered here, from the mustachioed pitcher to the juiced-up slugger. 
Even female players are included, which is a pleasant surprise. I also 
adore how the players and their corresponding abilities are depicted in 
the form of baseball cards. Going through them, I felt like I was 
fingering through my father’s dusty collection of old Topps cards – it’s
 all so frickin’ cool! Now, I understand that the art and the emotions 
they provoke might be lost on someone who’s never cared about baseball 
or had similar baseball-related memories. And yet, even if you fall into
 that category, I still think that you’ll find something redeeming about
 how this game is presented.</p>
<p>Regardless of how thoughtful and genuine the artwork feels, <em>Bottom of the 9<sup>th</sup> </em>needs
 to have convincing gameplay or it wouldn’t be worth it. Fortunately, 
the gameplay here really provokes the same edge-of-your-seat thrills 
that a real-life bottom of the ninth creates. As the pitcher, picking 
which area of the strike zone to throw to is intense, considering that 
the hitter knows where you’d like to throw it. When the hitter guesses 
incorrectly and you earn an advantage, it feels so uplifting. 
Conversely, when the hitter guesses correctly and clobbers the ball, 
it’s downright devastating. Surprisingly, there’s a lot of deduction 
that goes on here, especially for the hitter. Analyzing the pitcher’s 
body language, in addition to how many “ace” pitch locations they have 
remaining, requires skill and is definitely fun. Just like in real 
baseball, every at bat is a battle between the pitcher and hitter – this
 is very savvy game design.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-2957" src="assets/Hitting-Card-Explain.jpg" alt="bottom of the 9th review - hitting card" sizes="(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px" width="331" height="265">Once
 the pitcher and hitter select their pitch and swing locations, dice 
need to be rolled. For the pitcher, two dice are rolled to determine if a
 ball or strike is thrown, as well as how good that ball or strike is. 
The hitter counters with their own roll to determine whether or not they
 make contact, take a strike, or take a ball. Now I must admit, figuring
 out the outcome of a pitch and swing is a lot more complicated than it 
should be. There’s a table in the rulebook (and on a card) that you’ll 
have to refer to in order to find out if there was a hit or not, and 
constantly checking this table quickly becomes tedious. Also, whenever 
we’ve played, there haven’t been as many hits as we would’ve liked. 
Since it all comes down to a dice roll, sometimes luck (or bad luck) can
 take over a session of <em>Bottom of the 9<sup>th</sup></em> in a 
detrimental way. Choosing pitch and swing locations ahead of time help 
mitigate the luck a bit, but still, it’s way too present here sometimes,
 and that’s a shame.</p>
<p>However, when someone finally makes contact, the adrenaline really 
starts pumping. At that point, the pitcher and the hitter both pick up 
their D6s and roll until one of them gets a five or a six. If the hitter
 rolls a five or six first, then the runner is safe, but if it’s the 
other way around, the base runner is out. These rolls are so 
entertaining and rush-inducing that it’s hard to describe in text. And 
don’t worry, the hitter has an opportunity to crush the baseball and 
avoid the base-running dice rolls altogether, which is a shrewd caveat 
to the gameplay.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-2964" src="assets/BOT9-Board-Setup.jpg" alt="bottom of the 9th review - game board" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" width="340" height="336">Once the pitcher gets three outs, they win that game of <em>Bottom of the 9<sup>th</sup></em>,
 but if the hitter drives in a run, they win instead. Sadly, sessions of
 this game don’t last that long, but the designers came up with several 
variants, including ones that allow you to play more than one inning. In
 fact, the people involved in making this game basically covered 
everything there is to cover when it comes to baseball and the bottom of
 the ninth inning. I’m very impressed by this game’s attention to detail
 in regards to the artwork and gameplay, the latter of which is truly 
exhilarating sometimes. Sure, <em>Bottom of the 9<sup>th</sup> </em>is 
not without its flaws – there’s too much luck involved with some of the 
gameplay, and it probably shouldn’t be as easy as it is for the pitcher 
to exhaust their favorite pitch locations. And while some of the flaws I
 did notice usually bother me more with other games, I didn’t care about
 them as much here. This is probably because I love baseball, and 
therefore, I was predisposed to enjoying this game. Then again, you 
don’t need to love America’s Pastime in order to appreciate <em>Bottom of 9<sup>th</sup></em> – it’s just that good.</p>
<p>I give <em>Bottom of the 9<sup>th</sup></em> a: <strong>B+</strong></p>
<h2>Graham reviews Bottom of the 9th</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-704" src="assets/Headshot-Graham.png" alt="bottom of the 9th review - graham" sizes="(max-width: 149px) 100vw, 149px" width="149" height="200"></p>
<p><em>As you might’ve noticed from our <a href="https://boardcrazygames.com/bottom-9th-playthrough/">video playthrough</a>
 of Bottom of the 9th, I didn’t actually get a chance to play it. With 
that in mind, I decided that my review will be more of an overview of 
the observations I made about the game, and what elements of it 
intrigued me the most.</em></p>
<p>The first thing that stood out to me was the deception element of this game. In <em>Bottom of the 9th</em>,
 there are two players – one person plays the batters and the other the 
pitchers. On each turn, the pitcher is trying to get the batter to make a
 bad swing, while the batter is trying to predict where the pitcher is 
going to throw the baseball (i.e low and outside, low and inside, etc.).
 If the batter guesses correctly, then they earn some<img class="alignright wp-image-2960" src="assets/Fatigue-Tracker.jpg" alt="bottom of the 9th review - fatigue track" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" width="228" height="320">
 advantages on the swing, and if the guess incorrectly, then the pitcher
 gets some advantages on the pitch. At first, this portion of the game 
seems like luck, but you’ll notice that it becomes much more than luck. 
See, the pitcher can get fatigued by throwing certain pitches, so they 
have to be careful or they’ll get to a point where they’re only allowed 
to throw one type of pitch. In that case, the batter will always be able
 to guess which pitch will be thrown, so the pitcher needs to try and 
find a nice balance between each type of pitch. Meanwhile, the batter 
needs to try and bait the pitcher into throwing pitches that will 
fatigue them. All of this becomes a really interesting dynamic, and it’s
 one of the main things that draws me to this game.</p>
<p>Another thing that I found pretty interesting about <em>Bottom of the 9th</em>
 is that even though it seems simple, there’s quite a bit to it. 
Personally, I really enjoyed that because I think it’s such a great 
analog to the actual game of baseball. In <em>Bottom of the 9th</em>, 
you have to often reference the rulebook to see what rules apply to 
certain scenarios. Now, since I didn’t get a chance to play, I can’t 
tell if referencing the rulebook got frustrating after a while. But from
 the looks of it, it seemed like it wasn’t too overwhelming. I know some
 games can go a little overboard with having to reference the rulebook, 
but my feeling is that the rules are pretty clearly outlined and easy to
 understand.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2971" src="assets/High-Low-Tokens.jpg" alt="bottom of the 9th review - high low" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" width="360" height="223">The last thing that intrigued me about<em> Bottom of the 9th</em>
 is that it features sets of rules for different length games. In a 
standard game, you only play the last half inning, hence the name “<em>Bottom of the 9th”</em>.
 Fortunately, they provided rules in case you want to play a few innings
 or even more than that. To me, that’s awesome because it gives the 
player a lot of variety in how they can play, and it adds an extra level
 of replayability to the proceedings.</p>
<p>Although I didn’t get a chance to play this game yet, I think I got a
 pretty good feeling for it from watching my colleagues play. <em>Bottom of the 9th</em> seems like a ton of fun, and I can’t wait to try it out. As of now, I give <em>Bottom of the 9th</em> two thumbs up.</p>
