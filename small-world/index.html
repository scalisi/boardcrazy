 note: this review is meant to accompany our gameplay video and will not
 go in-depth on the game’s rules. If you’re interested in learning how 
the game is played, please watch the <a href="https://boardcrazygames.com/small-world-playthrough-board-crazy/">video</a>. It’s not bad.)</em></p>
<p>Of all the board games I’ve played in my life, <em>Small World</em> 
might be the only one that I would prefer to play as a digital game. 
It’s a fun game and comes with that Days of Wonder Seal of Quality that 
few other publishers can compete with, but <em>good lord</em> the 
components. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for games 
that require a lot of cleanup, but the number of pieces included in <em>Small World</em>
 does not feel as proportional to the game’s playtime as any other game 
I’ve played that comes with so many little bits and bobs to keep track 
of. It doesn’t ruin the game by any means, but yeah, a version where a 
computer is responsible for managing the pieces sounds really nice.</p>
<div id="attachment_2476" style="width: 694px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2476 size-full" src="assets/Orcs.png" alt="Small World Review - Orc Armies" sizes="(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px" width="684" height="137"><p class="wp-caption-text">The Orc tokens</p></div>
<p>I feel kind of bad leading with that criticism, especially just one week after praising the makers of <em>Ex Libris</em> for going the extra mile with their production choices. The general clutter of <em>Small World</em>
 is the result of no expense being spared in the publication of the 
game. Every playable race in the game comes with a specific number of 
cardboard tokens featuring matching artwork. Some of the races or 
classes come with abilities that require additional, unique cardboard 
tokens of their own. There are also the forgotten tribes and mountains 
that populate the board at the start of the game which, of course, are 
represented by cardboard tokens. But, I call it clutter because that’s 
what it all feels like. This is a situation where the game probably 
would have been better off if certain components had been simplified a 
bit, sacrificing some uniqueness for a more manageable experience. Maybe
 I’m less tolerant of this than I thought, but having to keep track of 
which section of the tray each piece goes back into felt like it took as
 much concentration as coming up with a sound strategy for victory.</p>
<p>Now that that’s all out of the way, though, let me talk about what I<em> do</em> like about <em>Small World</em>,
 which is mostly everything else. As I mentioned previously, the game is
 well-made, as all Days of Wonder products tend to be. I’m ever the fan 
of vibrant art, so the colorful game boards are a major plus in my book.
 And yes, I said boards, plural, as the game comes with not one, but two
 double-sided boards for different player counts. This adds another 
level to the game’s already pretty high replayability, if you’re able to
 corral different numbers of players together.</p>
<div id="attachment_2473" style="width: 597px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2473" src="assets/Gameboard.png" alt="Small World Review - Gameboard" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" width="587" height="317"><p class="wp-caption-text">One of the game board configurations</p></div>
<p>The game also moves pretty quickly, considering how much there can be
 to keep track of at any given time. The simplified “battle” system, if 
you can call it that, helps in this regard. The bigger army always wins,
 with the possible of exception of the die roll on the last move. I like
 nice, in-depth combat rules, but they weren’t necessary in <em>Small World,</em>
 and I’m glad they kept it simple. The standout mechanic though, is of 
course the random race/class combinations. There are tons of possible 
combinations, which means you can keep playing <em>Small World</em> for a
 long time without feeling like you’ve seen it all before. And keeping 
an eye out for a killer combo is a bit of fun every time a new one is 
revealed.</p>
<p>The scoring at the end is also really enjoyable. Point tokens are all
 kept face down, so while you can kind of keep track of how well 
everyone is doing, you won’t know for sure who has won until the very 
end. This is both a good way to keep players from feeling dejected and a
 good source of tension and drama, as you never know what point value 
will be revealed next. Overall, <em>Small World</em> is a good family 
game filled with nice touches that is held back ever-so-slightly by what
 I could only describe as excessive ambition. Still, I’ll give it a 
recommendation, as the good definitely outweighs the bad.</p>
<p>D’s Rating: Three and One-Half Stars out of Five.</p>
<h2>Will reviews Small World</h2>
<p><img class=" wp-image-835 alignleft" src="assets/Will_Headshot-e1494900306817.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" width="150" height="200">In
 2017, Small World is old and played out for many gamers, and yet, Days 
of Wonder continues to publish new expansions for it to this day. After 
playing Small World recently, the reason why these new expansions are 
still being made became readily apparent – this game holds up. In its 
eight years of existence, Small World has become time-tested and 
beloved, and for good reason. The intuitive rules, area control 
gameplay, and fantasy theme still work well, and most importantly, the 
game is really fun.</p>
<p>Components-wise, Small World is pretty impressive. Each box contains 
multiple boards (for different player counts) and a load of different 
tiles and pieces. All of the cardboard is rugged enough, especially with
 the Race Banners and Special Power Badges. All total, there are 
hundreds of components and they all work, both practically and 
thematically. Speaking of theme, I know that a lot of gamers complain 
that Small World is merely a reskinning of Vinci, and while they might 
be right, that complaint doesn’t really matter. The fantasy theme 
definitely works for this game, and the artwork is very eye-catching.</p>
<div id="attachment_2470" style="width: 564px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2470" src="assets/Berserk-Halfling.png" alt="Small World Review - Berserk Halflings" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px" width="554" height="207"><p class="wp-caption-text">The “Beserk” Special Power Badge and the “Halflings” Race Banner</p></div>
<p>Not only that, this game is easy to learn and endlessly entertaining 
as well. Basically, the goal of Small World is to claim as many 
territories on the board while also targeting specific locations 
(mountains, caves, etc.) that may earn you extra coins (victory points) 
because of racial bonuses. There’s a bit more to it than that, but once 
you grasp that simple premise, playing Small World at a high level 
becomes rather effortless. To me, that straightforward approach is a 
major plus, but I know that there are some gamers who might be turned 
off by it. Also, there’s a good deal of randomness in regards to which 
races and special powers appear and when. That could be problematic if a
 really powerful combination comes out early that leaves the other 
players scrambling to keep up with whoever claims it. In other words, 
this game might have been inspired by Euro games, but a Euro game it is 
not.</p>
<div id="attachment_2477" style="width: 358px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-2477" src="assets/Race-and-Power-List.png" alt="Small World Review - List of races and powers" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px" width="348" height="354"><p class="wp-caption-text">Every player gets this sheet with Race and Special Power descriptions</p></div>
<p>Since I keep referring to the “Races” and “Special Powers”, I should 
probably give my two cents on those. To start, I really love the variety
 of races and powers included in Small World, and the sheer amount of 
combinations of the two is astonishing and results in a high level of 
replayability. If you’re not too familiar with this game, getting to 
know the individual races and their strengths / weaknesses is a truly 
satisfying experience. For instance, Orcs earn bonus coins for each 
region they conquer that isn’t empty, and if they were paired with the 
Pillaging power, then they would earn additional coins for conquering 
those non-empty territories. That’s a pretty potent combination to use 
for the first time, but one that would rank in the middle of race / 
power potency. This leads me to my main issue with Small World – some of
 the races and special powers are way more useful than others. This 
means that some combinations, like Stout Ghouls, are entirely stronger 
than other combinations, like Forest Dwarves. Balance is a major part of
 any board game, and it’s safe to say that Small World “can” fall short 
in this regard. I say “can” because there’s no guarantee that 
over-powered combinations will occur in your game, but it’s a 
possibility, so keep that in mind.</p>
<p>It’s time to put this review “in decline” since I don’t have much 
more to say about Small World that hasn’t already been said over its 
eight years of existence. Since I just said it, I should point out that 
putting races “in decline” and then drafting new ones is a really solid 
mechanic that separates Small World from the area-control-game pack. So 
that’s it – this game is highly enjoyable and definitely easy to learn. 
Sure, there’s a degree of randomness and imbalance to the gameplay that 
can put a damper on some sessions, but the level of those negatives 
changes from one game to the next. Small World may be old, but its 
addictive qualities and simple approach have allowed it to hold up over 
time.</p>
<p>I give Small World a: <strong>B</strong></p>
<h2>Graham reviews Small World</h2>
<p><img class=" wp-image-704 alignleft" src="assets/Headshot-Graham.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 149px) 100vw, 149px" width="149" height="200">It
 feels a little weird reviewing Small World, considering it released 
almost 10 years ago. Everything that could be said has been said, and so
 much has changed in the board gaming community that it seems a little 
irrelevant. Still, Small World holds up pretty well. It is a little 
chaotic, but the gameplay is fun, the rules are simple, and the race and
 power combos are awesome.</p>
<p>The artwork and mechanics are are noticeably ‘Days of Wonder’, and 
that’s a good thing because I think DoW does a great job creating 
enjoyable games. And just like other DoW games, Small World’s rules are 
easy to understand. The rulebook doesn’t cover every scenario, but there
 is enough information online to find out everything you need to know. 
An example that comes to mind is the Trolls’ special ability that allows
 you to place a Troll Lair once per turn. Now, the declined side of the 
race card indicates the power remains even if the Trolls go into 
decline, but does this just mean they get to keep the +1 bonus from the 
already existing lairs, or do they get to keep placing lairs while in 
decline? I think the community agrees that you shouldn’t be allowed to 
place lairs while in decline, but there does seem to be some conflicting
 explanations in the rulebook. I imagine learning the game when it first
 released was probably not a simple as it is now, but overall, the 
rulebook does a good job at keeping the explanations quick and simple.</p>
<div id="attachment_2471" style="width: 562px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2471 " src="assets/Bivouacking-Giants.png" alt="Small World Review - Bivouacking Giants" sizes="(max-width: 552px) 100vw, 552px" width="552" height="208"><p class="wp-caption-text">The “Bivouacking” Special Power Badge and the “Giants” Race Banner</p></div>
<p>The gameplay in Small World is really exciting. There are two main 
aspects of the gameplay: the moving/attacking phase and the decline 
phase. After you’ve chosen a race, you can place your armies on the 
board and try to conquer regions. The more regions you conquer, the more
 gold you get at the end of your turn. You need two armies to capture an
 empty region, and then 1 extra army for each enemy defender, mountain, 
fortress, troll lair, or encampment. This creates a balance between 
keeping your armies strong so your opponents can’t conquer you and 
conquering more spaces to collect more gold. The next aspect of Small 
World is choosing to put your race into decline. If you choose to enter 
into decline, this means you are done utilizing your race and want to 
start over with a new one. When you enter into decline, you flip your 
race card and all of your armies on the board to their other side, 
collect gold from your controlled territories, and then at the beginning
 of your next turn, choose a new race and start the process over again. 
Going into decline is risky and kind of nerve-wracking, since you lose a
 whole turn and cannot conquer new territories and possibly collect more
 gold. Typically, you want to go into decline if your race is really 
weak or if there is a particularly good race and power combo available. 
Overall, the gameplay has a healthy amount of decisions that you have to
 weigh, which makes for a great strategy game.</p>
<div id="attachment_2505" style="width: 404px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2505 " src="assets/Declined-Orcs.png" alt="Small World Review - Declined Orc" sizes="(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px" width="394" height="212"><p class="wp-caption-text">The “Orcs” Race Banner when it’s in decline</p></div>
<p>With that said, Small World’s gameplay can be slightly chaotic. This 
is probably because of all of the different components involved with the
 race and power combinations. Each race comes with a set of unique army 
tokens, and some of the races come with special tokens like troll lairs 
or encampments. On top of that, a lot of these pieces get moved around 
each turn, so it gets a little crazy with so many moving parts. However,
 I do feel that these parts are somewhat necessary. One of the best 
aspects of Small World, if not the best one, is the race and power 
combinations. And since there’s probably not a better way to represent 
all of the armies and special abilities, you’ll live to deal with all of
 the moving components.</p>
<div id="attachment_2472" style="width: 311px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-2472" src="assets/Fortress.png" alt="Small World Review - Fortress" sizes="(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" width="301" height="295"><p class="wp-caption-text">The “Fortified” Special Power provides its users with these Fortress pieces</p></div>
<p>Speaking of race and power combos, they are fantastic because of how 
they interact with each other. For example, fortified trolls would be a 
really powerful combination to have because your power (Fortification) 
allows you to place fortresses in your controlled territories. These 
fortresses give a you +1 to defense and an extra gold. Also, the trolls 
allow you to place a troll lair on each region you own that also give 
you a +1 to defense. All these defense bonuses allow you to keep your 
armies smaller and more spread out. So when a good combination comes up,
 you have to weigh the pros and cons of going into decline to snag the 
new combo. Small World also does an admirable job balancing the the race
 and combo selections. At all times, there are six different combos that
 you can choose from. These are drawn at random, and their position on 
the race track is determined by the order in which they were drawn. If 
you select a combination that is not in 1st position, you must place a 
gold on all of the other banners in front of it. So if you take the 
combination in the 3rd position, then you must place gold pieces on the 
the banners in the 1st and 2nd positions. Then, if someone were to 
select a combo in the 1st or 2nd positions, they would get to collect 
the gold on the race they choose. This is a clever way to coerce players
 to select a weaker race/power combination and another example of the 
thoughtful design of Small World.</p>
<p>Overall, I think Small World is a lot of fun, and I can see why it 
has received so much praise over the years. I still feel a little 
strange reviewing a game like this because it is hard to understand what
 this game meant for the community when it originally released. I guess 
the fact that I had a good time playing it and desire to play it again 
shows that this game has held up well over almost a decade. I give Small
 World 1 thumb up.</p>
