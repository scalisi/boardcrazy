at Baldur’s Gate review, Board Crazy looks at the Dungeons &amp; 
Dragons-themed reboot of Betrayal at House on the Hill. Betrayal at 
Baldur’s Gate was designed by Chris Dupuis &amp; Mike Mearls, and is 
published by Avalon Hill Games &amp; Wizards of the Coast. In this game,
 players explore Baldur’s Gate until one of them becomes a traitor, at 
which point all bets are off! See our review below.</p>

<h2>D reviews Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate</h2>
<p><em><img class=" wp-image-834 alignleft" src="assets/D_Headshot-e1494900449430.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 142px) 100vw, 142px" width="142" height="201">(Author’s note: this review is meant to accompany our <a href="https://boardcrazygames.com/betrayal-at-baldurs-gate-board-crazy-plays/">gameplay video</a>
 and will not go in-depth on the game’s rules. If you’re interested in 
learning how the game is played, please watch the video. It’s not bad.)</em></p>
<p>Before I begin my review for <em>Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate</em>, there’s something that I feel I need to mention: I don’t like <em>Betrayal at House on the Hill</em>. At all. I appreciate that <em>House on the Hill</em>
 is pretty well-regarded, but basically nothing about it appeals to me, 
all the way down to the horror movie tropes that gave it its flavor. So,
 my optimism going in to this one was somewhat tempered, but the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>
 license gave me a bit of hope. I love D&amp;D, and Baldur’s Gate is 
about as prestigious a setting as it gets within the official lore. 
Plus, Mike Mearls is one of the co-designers of the game and if anyone 
can make a good D&amp;D game, it’s him. So is <em>Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate</em> a marked improvement over the original game? Not really.</p>
<div id="attachment_2275" style="width: 319px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-2275" src="assets/Race-and-Class-Card.gif" alt="Betrayal at Baldur's Gate Review - Class and Race Card" width="309" height="297"><p class="wp-caption-text">This
 is the character card that keeps track of your stats and features your 
special ability. In Grim’s case, his special ability is Devotion.</p></div>
<p>It turns out that these games need more than a fancy <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>
 sheen to make them enjoyable to me. For starters, I really don’t dig 
horror in general, and I feel like it’s a particularly hard sell in the 
medium of board games. Simply put, it’s basically impossible to make a 
board game that’s legitimately scary. At best, a board game can be tense
 in a way that really tests your nerve. <em>Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate</em>,
 unfortunately, lacks tension. The first half of the game, when everyone
 is on the same side, is particularly relaxed. At worst, you’ll run into
 some inconveniences, but you’re just as likely to find a shiny new 
weapon or item. Things are slightly tenser once the haunt begins and the
 game becomes competitive, but in my experience, any potential sense of 
excitement is usually subdued by confusion over the rules or an 
unbalanced adventure. So, <em>BaBG</em> fails as a horror game. <em>Jenga</em> is scarier.</p>
<p>Now, none of that would matter much if the game was still fun to play. To that end I would offer this: <em>Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate</em>
 could be fun. I say “could” because I don’t want to make any 
guarantees, but I’m confident that under perfect conditions a game of <em>BaBG</em>
 could be a really good time. The revealing of tiles, acquisition of 
loot, stat tracking, rolling dice, and sudden but inevitable betrayal 
are all fun mechanics. Unfortunately, the degree of randomness present 
in this game makes everything a bit of a crapshoot. The distribution of 
loot and the tiles present on the board once the haunt starts can lead 
to scenarios where it’s practically impossible for one side to win the 
game.</p>

<p>Of course, one of the game’s major selling points is that there are <em>fifty</em>
 different haunts included. So sure, maybe you had one bad game. But who
 cares when you can play it 49 more times and have a different 
experience? Well, there are a couple of problems here too. For starters,
 the first two times we played this game we got the exact same haunt via
 different conditions. Now, this is probably a statistical aberration, 
but it’s still lame that it’s even a possibility. More importantly 
though, having fifty haunts just leads to more problems than 
replayability. It’s just impossible to balance and playtest that many 
scenarios, and while that may not bother some people, it’s frustrating 
to someone like me. To make matters worse, these haunts introduce new 
gameplay mechanics that aren’t always easy to understand. Too add to 
that, the main rulebook usually offers no insight on how to deal with 
the quirks and caveats of the various haunts. Are all omens considered 
items or just some of them? I’m still not 100% on that. The game would 
be better if they had focused on a smaller number of really good haunts,
 with greater balance and rules clarity.</p>
<p>So, ultimately, my feelings on <em>Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate</em> are basically the same as they are for <em>Betrayal at House on the Hill</em>, despite the D&amp;D trappings. And maybe I shouldn’t be surprised by that, since <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-licensed
 games often have nothing to do with what makes it fun in the first 
place: character creation and roleplaying. Oh, and dice rolling. It’s a 
real shame they couldn’t adapt the game to work with d20s and custom 
characters in order to make it feel a bit more like proper D&amp;D. The 
painted miniatures included for the PCs are a nice touch, at least. So, 
those are my thoughts. If you like the original <em>Betrayal</em> game, 
then I imagine you will enjoy this one as well, especially if you prefer
 a fantasy setting to a horror one. But if you’re like me and didn’t 
enjoy the original or you’re simply bothered by a lack of cohesion in 
your board games, then I recommend giving this one a pass.</p>

<h2>Will reviews Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate</h2>
<p><img class=" wp-image-835 alignleft" src="assets/Will_Headshot-e1494900306817.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" width="150" height="200">Something
 tells me that I enjoyed Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate more than my 
colleagues, and that’s completely fine. After all, the game is hardly 
what I’d call “polished”, and many elements of it are rather 
frustrating. Honestly, I had only played Betrayal at House on the Hill a
 couple times, and I remembered that those sessions were pretty sloppy. 
These memories enabled me to temper my expectations for Baldur’s Gate, 
and I’m glad I did since that allowed me to see some of the good in this
 tabletop game. Yes, there are some pretty glaring negatives, but there 
are also some satisfying positives.</p>
<p>Starting with some of the good, the components included in the box 
are almost uniformly great. The location tiles are well made, and their 
artwork is catching and effective in regards to immersion in the 
setting. In fact, attractive art permeates everything in Betrayal at 
Baldur’s Gate’s box – it’s a real plus compared to a lot of similar 
games. My favorite physical elements of the game are the player 
character miniatures. They’re highly detailed <em>and</em> painted, and 
they could easily double as minis in a game of D&amp;D. In other words, 
they’re amazing. However, it’s important to remember that the physical 
components are, in many ways, window dressing for some of the issues 
with the gameplay.</p>

<p>Anyone who’s ever gamed knows that a good rulebook goes a long way in
 tabletop gaming. When it comes to Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate, I’d call 
the rulebook “frustratingly adequate”. Most of the information that 
you’ll need to complete a session is in there, but specific information 
is often not the easiest to find. And there’s a lot of moving parts in 
this game, so you will be referring to rulebook frequently. Not being 
able to find the answers to your questions quickly will slow down your 
session of Baldur’s Gate – that’s almost a guarantee. Still, you will 
eventually get used to the rules and things will speed up. It just takes
 entirely too long to get to that point.</p>
<p>Eventually, you’ll reach the point in every game of Betrayal at 
Baldur’s Gate when the betrayer is revealed and the Haunt begins. This 
should be one of the best moments in the game, but it was (for our 
group) one of the most annoying. On one hand, we did enjoy that the 
players split apart so they can read their specific mission in separate 
rooms. To clarify, there are two different handbooks that are included 
in the box along with the rulebook. One handbook is for the good guys; 
the other is for the betrayer, the bad guy. These handbooks include 
instructions for all 50 haunts in the game. It was these instructions 
that often bothered us. For instance, the player utilizing the monsters 
is supposed to give up all of their “items”, but there aren’t clear 
definitions of what constitutes an item. After all, some of the Omen 
cards are clearly items, such as weapons or armor. But other Omens are 
companions, such as fey creatures. Are we supposed to treat a fey like 
it’s an item? We were forced to house rule this, and we ended up 
deciding that companions weren’t items. How a question like this was 
overlooked during playtesting is perplexing to me, and I’m sure other 
players like you will have similar inquiries.</p>
<p>Once we were able to get past the “Item vs. Omen” debate, the game’s 
pacing picked up again. The first few minutes of the Haunt are really 
fun, as both parties are trying to ascertain their opponent’s objective.
 Unfortunately, we quickly gleaned that Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate was 
designed with more than three players in mind. In a 3-player game, being
 the monster is way too easy (unless you’re the unluckiest dice roller 
ever). *<strong>Video Spoiler*</strong> In the video, you’ll see that I 
voluntarily sacrificed one of my minions to allow D and Graham to have a
 chance to win. My point is – I shouldn’t have had to do that. Instead, 
the designers should’ve re-balanced some of the Haunts for games with 
fewer than four players. It makes me think – many of these issues came 
up immediately in our first 3-player session, so I don’t know how they 
didn’t during play-testing. Perhaps this game wasn’t play-tested that 
much with 3-player groups, which would be a forgivable oversight, given 
the amount of Haunts and other variables. I do think this game can be a 
lot of fun if you’re playing with four or more people, so that’s how I 
recommend it be played.</p>

 Item, and Omen Cards – the tiles you pick up throughout this game have 
one of these symbols on it. When you draw a tile, you also pick up the 
top card of the corresponding deck.</p></div>
<p>Even with all of these nagging problems, I still enjoyed a lot of the
 gameplay, especially how it encourages strategy when setting up the 
tiles. Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate starts off as a cooperative experience,
 but then transitions into a competitive battle – that’s also really 
cool. In addition, sessions move relatively quickly once you get the 
hang of the rules, and since there are 50 haunts to play, there’s a 
boatload of replayability. Add all of that to the mostly first-rate 
components, and you realize there’s a sizeable amount of good things 
happening here. On the other hand, it’s a darn shame that certain rules 
are entirely unclear, and that the 3-player variant of this game is 
occasionally unplayable. It almost feels like Baldur’s Gate was released
 too early, as this game could’ve used a few more months of play-testing
 and polishing. Yes, that may have been difficult with 50 haunts, but 
this game kind of needs it. As it is, Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate is in 
many ways a reflection of its rulebook – flawed but effective. 
Effectiveness is nice and all, but I think we all prefer “exceptional”, 
and this game is not that.</p>
<p>I give Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate a: <strong>C+</strong></p>
<h2>Graham reviews Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate</h2>

roll 4 dice and match the number rolled with the numbers on the card, 
and follow the instructions.</p></div>
<p><img class=" wp-image-704 alignleft" src="assets/Headshot-Graham.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 149px) 100vw, 149px" width="149" height="200">Unlike
 my colleagues, I never played Betrayal at House on the Hill, so I 
didn’t really know what to expect. They mentioned to me that they had 
played Betrayal at House on the Hill improperly and wanted to make sure 
we get it right this time. <em>They</em>&nbsp;<em>obviously recognized 
the mistakes they made when playing Betrayal at House on the Hill, so 
Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate should be no problem, right?</em> Not exactly.
 This frustrates me because at its core, Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate seems
 like a really cool game. Exploring the city of Baldur’s Gate, 
collecting weapons and armor, searching creepy catacombs, and finding 
cool magical items like the Deck of Many Things all are awesome things 
to do. On top of that, one of you becomes a traitor and the others have 
to stop that person. How could this NOT be awesome? Well…</p>
<p>First, the rulebook doesn’t cover nearly enough situations. In other 
words, it doesn’t sufficiently explain the rules that are there, and 
it’s really disorganized. Most of our playthroughs were spent scouring 
the rulebook for clarifications. For example, the rulebook states that “<strong>most </strong>omens
 are treated like items.” Okay, when the haunt starts, the traitor might
 have to discard all of their items. Does the traitor discard all item 
cards or anything that can be perceived as an item, including any Omens?
 Someone knows the answer out there, but we still don’t. We were 
eventually able to find answers to most of our questions, but it’s 
annoying when you’re reading the section of the rulebook you assume 
would have your answer, but it’s actually tucked away in the margins of 
another page. Ultimately, reading the rulebook is a grueling task and 
I’m still not over it.</p>
<div id="attachment_2274" style="width: 226px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-2274" src="assets/Potion-of-Healing.gif" alt="Betrayal at Baldur's Gate Review - The Potion of Healing" width="216" height="407"><p class="wp-caption-text">The Potion of Healing Item Card – this card allows you to restore either your might or speed to its starting value.</p></div>
<p>My next issue with Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate is that the Haunts are 
not balanced. It seems the traitor always has a significant advantage. 
For example, in our playthrough, the only way to kill the Servant of 
Bhaal and his cultists is by using a special item, and the only way to 
get those items is by trading other items for them. If you haven’t had 
the luck to collect a ton of items before the Haunt, then you’re pretty 
much screwed. I think the issue with the haunts is that they were most 
likely designed with more people in mind, which is fine. But it also 
means that the game is pretty much pointless to play with only three 
people.</p>
<p>Both of my points above are frustrating, but the worst part about 
Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate is that it’s just not that fun to play. On 
paper, it sounds like it should be an awesome game, but I just don’t 
feel like I am accomplishing anything when I play it. The pre-haunt 
gameplay gets boring quickly, the haunts are cool but unbalanced, and 
there really isn’t any strategy to either phase of the game. In the 
pre-haunt phase, the adventurers explore the city, complete fun events, 
collect items, and receive Omens, but overall it still feels pointless. 
There isn’t a way to prepare yourself for the haunt or try and decrease 
the odds of you being the traitor. Combine that with items and stats 
often becoming useless during the Haunt phase, and it makes it feel as 
though you’re just wasting time. Now the Haunts are cool and exciting, 
and it’s fun that each team has separate rules that only they can see. 
This adds a lot of mystery and suspense to the game, but that all gets 
overshadowed by the unbalanced nature of the Haunts that I described 
previously. Ultimately, it just seems there really isn’t a lot of 
strategy and planning involved, which is why I probably feel like I’m 
not accomplishing anything when I play Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate.</p>

Everybody starts in the Elfsong Tavern and explores the city from there.</p></div>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t really have much positive to say about 
Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate. It’s shame because the idea of the Betrayal 
games is so cool, but the game experience just never lives up to the 
idea. I can’t write Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate off entirely because I 
would like to try it with more people. Also, it does receive a ton of 
praise from the board gaming community, so maybe I’m just missing 
something. Overall, my initial experience with this game was confusing, 
frustrating, and underwhelming. I give Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate one 
thumb down.</p>
