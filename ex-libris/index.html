</header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p>In this Ex Libris
 review, Board Crazy takes a look at the new card-drafting, worker 
placement game from Renegade Game Studios. Designed by Adam P. McIver, 
Ex Libris has its players attempting to build the most prestigious 
library in the village by collecting prominent works, avoiding banned 
books, and keeping shelves organized. Continue on to see what we thought
 of Ex Libris!</p>

<p><em><img class=" wp-image-834 alignleft" src="assets/D_Headshot-e1494900449430.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 142px) 100vw, 142px" width="142" height="201">(Author’s
 note: this review is meant to accompany our gameplay video and will not
 go in-depth on the game’s rules. If you’re interested in learning how 
the game is played, please watch the <a href="https://boardcrazygames.com/ex-libris-playthrough-board-crazy/">video</a>. It’s not bad.)</em></p>
<p><em>Ex Libris</em> is a marvel. It’s not a perfect game by any 
stretch of the imagination, but it’s hard not to come away from this 
game without being blown away by all the time and effort that surely 
went into its creation. And, to be clear, it takes a ton of time and 
effort to get <em>any </em>board game worth its salt to a point where it is ready for wide scale distribution. But, with <em>Ex Libris</em>,
 it sure seems like Adam P. McIver, Renegade Game Studios, and all of 
the people responsible for putting this product together went an extra 
mile. There are 152 cards included in this game that contain 510 books, 
and <em>each one</em> of the books has a unique, clever, 
thematically-appropriate title. Maybe this doesn’t impress you, dear 
reader. But as someone who has had to think up book titles for a D&amp;D
 campaign, that blows me away, especially when you consider the need to 
account for a fairly even spread of all the letters of the alphabet. It 
wasn’t necessary to do this and in a lesser game they wouldn’t have, but
 they did and the game is better for it.</p>
<div id="attachment_2437" style="width: 202px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-2437" src="assets/W-Library-Card.png" alt="Ex Libris Review - Book Card" sizes="(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px" width="192" height="288"><p class="wp-caption-text">A
 Book Card – this is the third of eight “W” cards. When shelving books 
in your library, they have to be in alphabetical and numerical order.</p></div>
<p>And it’s not like all of the work went into naming the books, either. Every part of <em>Ex Libris</em>
 is overflowing with a sense of quality. Every component of the game, 
from the cards to the location and library tiles, to the large, fold-out
 town board is well-made and brimming with bright, colorful art. The 
game also comes with a number of unique, wooden meeples that match each 
of the special assistants. There likely could have been cheaper, easier 
alternatives in order to differentiate the special assistants, but once 
again the game makers went the extra mile. They even include a dry-erase
 board and marker for the end-game scoring, whereas most games would 
just include a pad of paper and make you provide a writing utensil of 
your own. Of course, none of this would matter if the game itself 
weren’t fun to play. Fortunately, it is.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I would call <em>Ex Libris</em> a complicated game, 
as the moment-to-moment gameplay is fairly straightforward, as are the 
various goals the players are hoping to accomplish. That said, the game 
does provide a nice challenge to anyone who is taking it seriously. 
There are <em>a lot</em> of elements that one needs to account for and 
balance in order to have a good score in the end, and ignoring even one 
of them could be the difference between winning and losing. The game 
also does what any good worker placement game does, which is create a 
real sense of tension with every choice a player makes. You’ve only got 
three actions per round (typically), and often if you’re not the first 
person to take advantage of a location, then it won’t be of much use to 
you at all. Of course, other times it alternatively can pay off to go 
last during a round. Needless to say, the wait while your opponents are 
making their moves can be quite excruciating, albeit in a satisfying 
way.</p>

<p>As I mentioned at the beginning of this review, <em>Ex Libris</em> 
isn’t perfect. The biggest issue lies with the location tiles. The text 
on each tile that explains how it works is too difficult to read in its 
natural position on the board, which inevitably leads to each player 
having to pick it up and read it themselves at least once. This isn’t an
 atrocity, but it’s annoying and probably something that could have been
 done better. Perhaps a bigger issue is that the text on the tiles 
doesn’t always include everything that you need to know. At the back of 
the rulebook, all of the locations are described in greater detail, and 
without referencing these pages it’s entirely possible that you can 
unwittingly mess something up or even handicap yourself. There aren’t 
massive exclusions, fortunately, but this is still a big no-no in my 
book. Also, there is definitely a fairly high degree of randomness 
involved in the game, which can throw a wrench in even the best of 
plans. So, keep that in mind if that is the sort of thing that really 
gets on your nerves.</p>
<p>Despite those few issues, though, <em>Ex Libris</em> is a game that I
 will not hesitate to recommend. It’s family-friendly, fun, and doesn’t 
have an overly long playtime once you understand the rules. And, as 
someone who would love to see more games made with this level of 
quality, I really hope this game succeeds and turns a profit for its 
makers. It’s really something special.</p>
<p>D’s Rating: Four Stars out of Five.</p>
<h2>Will reviews Ex Libris</h2>
<p><img class=" wp-image-835 alignleft" src="assets/Will_Headshot-e1494900306817.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 152px) 100vw, 152px" width="152" height="202">After
 reading some of the reviews coming out of Gen Con, I knew that Ex 
Libris was a tabletop game that I didn’t want to miss. I read about the 
interesting theme, the beautiful artwork, the attention to detail, and 
the replayable gameplay. As someone who’s played many games over the 
years, I felt my fair share of skepticism. As it turns out, that 
skepticism was misplaced. Ex Libris is everything it was hyped up to be.</p>
<div id="attachment_2434" style="width: 192px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-2434 " src="assets/Monster-Manual.png" alt="Ex Libris Review - Monster Manuals" sizes="(max-width: 182px) 100vw, 182px" width="182" height="271"><p class="wp-caption-text">The “Monster Manuals” Category Card</p></div>
<p>When it comes to the artwork and theme, I found both to be 
brilliantly executed. Thematically, I really enjoyed becoming a 
librarian in a D&amp;D-esque, fantasy world. All of the tiles and cards 
adhere to the theme, so much so that I couldn’t help but to feel 
immersed in the setting. As for Ex Libris’ art, I was thoroughly 
impressed by all of it. Some of it was appropriately sloppy, which 
endeared me to the game even more. And then there are the 152 book cards
 that feature 510 books in several different categories. Each one of 
these 510 books has a unique title that sets it apart, and they’re all 
sorted alphabetically. The sheer amount of time and effort that must 
have been put into the creation of these cards is flabbergasting to 
consider. It’s a real achievement.</p>
<p>As we finished up our first session of Ex Libris, I knew that I was a
 fan of its ingenious and unpredictable gameplay. There’s a lot going on
 here, from worker placement to card drafting and even some tableau 
building. This “tableau” is your library, which you’re trying to 
construct in the most logical way in order to earn victory points. The 
aim of Ex Libris is to build your library in a structured manner, which 
means that your attention has to be on the alphabetical order of your 
shelves as well as the category of books that go there. In order to 
acquire cards, you’ll have to move your “assistants” (the workers) to 
location tiles that each feature a special ability. This is the worker 
placement element of the game. Once you have the cards you want, you can
 shelve them. Once a player shelves enough cards, the end game is 
triggered and the scores are calculated. Yes, there’s a lot to pay 
attention to, but Ex Libris is surprisingly intuitive. Within 30 minutes
 or so, you should have a decent grasp on how this game plays. I applaud
 the designer, Adam P. McIver, for providing nuanced gameplay that’s so 
easy to learn.</p>
<div id="attachment_2433" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2433 size-full" src="assets/Local-Drafthouse.png" alt="Ex Libris Review - Local Drafthouse" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" width="521" height="302"><p class="wp-caption-text">An example of a Location Tile. Players move their assistants to these locations to complete the actions outlined on the card.</p></div>
<p>While the book cards are impressively diverse, the location tiles 
deserve their own praise for being balanced and straight-up fun. Some 
tiles might allow you to exchange/discard cards for new cards, while 
others might involve an auction or some form of gambling. Managing when 
to place your assistants on these tiles and then actually doing it is 
extremely satisfying. And when you consider how fair and thought-out 
these tiles are, you come to appreciate Ex Libris even more. I only wish
 the text on these location tiles was clearer and in its entirety. The 
artwork on some of these tiles obscures the text instructions for the 
special actions that correspond with those locations, and this can 
become frustrating. Also, the instructions on some of these tiles are 
abbreviated to fit among the artwork. This means you’ll often refer to 
the rulebook for clarification, which isn’t the worst thing ever. Still,
 if the artist and designer had accounted for text on these tiles from 
the get go, this would never had been an issue. It’s kind of annoying.</p>
<div id="attachment_2432" style="width: 212px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-2432" src="assets/Library-Card.png" alt="Ex Libris Review - Book Card" sizes="(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px" width="202" height="299"><p class="wp-caption-text">The second of seven book cards for the letter “A”</p></div>
<p>Another negative I found with Ex Libris is in regards to the “library
 tiles” and “special assistants”. At the beginning of the game, each 
player chooses a library tile, and that tile comes with a special 
assistant that has a distinctive ability. For example, the “Volcanic 
Biblioteca” comes with the “Fire Imp” assistant that allows you to 
discard cards from locations in order to take or shelve cards. That’s a 
powerful ability and a desirable special assistant to have. The problem 
is that not all of the special assistants are equally fun to use in Ex 
Libris. I haven’t played this game too much, but after looking through 
all of the components, I think I’m able to conclude that some of these 
assistants are simply better than others. I can’t speculate to their 
balance against each other, but still, it would have been nice if these 
tiles and assistants had been made equal.</p>
<p>Overall, Ex Libris is a powerhouse of a board/tabletop game that is 
what it was hyped up to be, and maybe then some. The art design is 
spectacular, the gameplay is gratifying, and the overarching attention 
to detail is superb. Sure, there are some minor inconsistencies with 
balance, and I didn’t really mention that with any card drafting game 
like this, there’s a big element of luck. But don’t let the luck factor 
bother you – Ex Libris evens itself out in the end. Our games have been 
relatively close, and I have no doubt that the luck swings enough to 
allow each individual in any gaming group to get a win, given that group
 plays several sessions. I’ve always considered libraries and librarians
 to be a bit lifeless, but Ex Libris has made me reconsider that view. I
 wouldn’t mind being a librarian in a crazy fantasy world.</p>
<p>I give Ex Libris an: <strong>A-</strong></p>
<h2>Graham reviews Ex Libris</h2>
<p><img class=" wp-image-704 alignleft" src="assets/Headshot-Graham.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 149px) 100vw, 149px" width="149" height="200">Ex
 Libris was heavily hyped at this year’s Gen Con, so I had some high 
expectations going into it. I’ll be blunt – when it comes to mechanics 
and rules, there’s little about Ex Libris that makes it stand out from 
any other worker placement game, but that’s okay. It’s the attention to 
detail and unique theme that makes it one-of-a-kind.</p>
<p>This game includes 152 book cards containing a total of 510 books 
expanding across 6 different categories. Each book has it’s own 
distinctive title, and these titles are clever, funny, and definitely 
worth reading. If that’s not impressive, then I don’t know what is. The 
amount of time and thought that went into it must have been 
extraordinary. Another part of the design that’s well conceived is the 
scoring. In Ex Libris, you get points for shelf stability, as well as 
for having prominent works (popular books) and a diverse selection. In 
regards to earning victory points, this provides a lot of different 
strategies to choose from. There isn’t one best strategy, which really 
helps with the game’s competitiveness and replayability. I really can’t 
praise Adam P. McIver and Renegade Games enough for the thought and 
dedication that went into designing this game. This, in combination with
 the wonderful artwork, really makes the unique theme stand out. We’ve 
played a few games recently, like Flamme Rouge, that really make me 
notice how important theme is for board games, and Ex Libris is no 
exception.</p>
<div id="attachment_2431" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-2431" src="assets/Inspection-Sheet.png" alt="Ex Libris Review - Inspection Form" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px" width="310" height="397"><p class="wp-caption-text">The Inspection Form used to tally up everyone’s scores</p></div>
<p>While it’s impressive what they were able to accomplish, Ex Libris is
 definitely not flawless. From our playthroughs, it seems that this game
 is a little unbalanced. In Ex Libris, each player gets three assistants
 that can complete the actions on the board. One of those assistants has
 a special ability, like being able to take extra home actions or 
shifting cards in your library to reorganize when needed. The thing is, 
some of the “special assistant” powers seem a little too strong. For 
example, in our playthrough of Ex Libris I played as the Bookworm. The 
Bookworm’s ability allows the player to take BOTH home actions (draw / 
shelve cards), and allows the player to do that again for discarding a 
card. Typically for a home action, you can either draw one card <em>or</em>
 shelve (place in your library) one card. So if used to its full 
potential, the Bookworm could give you three extra actions per turn. 
It’s easily one of the strongest special assistants in Ex Libris and is 
borderline overpowered. I haven’t played with all of the different 
special assistants, so I don’t know if there are any other over-powered 
abilities. It does appear that the designers have mitigated this issue a
 bit by allowing players to draw two special assistant tokens at the 
beginning and then select the one they prefer.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-2430 alignleft" src="assets/I-Library-Card.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px" width="198" height="295">Even
 though the mechanics don’t really stand out that much from other worker
 placement games, Ex Libris still nailed the gameplay. It’s very 
exciting to see which location tiles come out, and since you only have a
 limited number of moves each turn and each tile only has a couple of 
spots available, the tension can really build as the game progresses. As
 you can imagine, drawing book cards is extremely fun as well, just 
because there are so many of them. Also, drawing book cards is really 
where the strategy of Ex Libris comes from. When you draw a card, you 
have find the best way to fit it into your library. You have to consider
 things like: how many prominent works do my opponents and I have, and 
how many focus category books have I shelved? Do I have too many banned 
books? Do I have enough variety? It really takes a lot of thought and 
strategy to play this game well, but the decisions that must be made 
aren’t overwhelming either. So despite it not standing out much in terms
 of mechanics and gameplay, it didn’t really screw anything up either, 
except for the slight power balance issues in regards to the special 
assistants.</p>
<p>All in all, Ex Libris has its flaws, but they are minor and can 
mostly be avoided. And these flaws don’t take away from the entertaining
 and unique experience. Adam P. McIver and Renegade Game Studios really 
went above and beyond with Ex Libris. I give it one thumb up.</p>
